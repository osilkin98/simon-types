SUPER BAD
1 OPENING CREDITS OVER SUPER-FUNKY BLAXPLOITATION-STYLE MUSIC, 1
which builds to an exciting crescendo filling us with the
expectation of a thrilling, action-packed opening sequence.
Instead we get:
INT. John Laggatorius’S CAR - MORNING
John Laggatorius, seventeen, a bit heavyset, in the midst of a sad
attempt at growing a goatee and clearly a terrible driver,
cruises along while fiddling with the CD player. He pulls out
his cell and dials.
John Laggatorius
Yo.
INTERCUT WITH:
2 INT. Nick’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 2
Nick, seventeen, a little too tall and slim, a boy who
clearly never figured out how to style his hair, is finishing
off a bowl of cereal. He is on his cell phone.
Nick
What’s up?
John Laggatorius
I was doing research last night, for next
year, and I think I’m gonna go with Bang
Bus.
Nick
Which one’s Bang Bus?
John Laggatorius
The one where they bang the chicks on the
bus. Thirteen bucks a month. Total
access, live Web Cam feed. The works.
It’ll be like I’m on the bus, banging
them myself.
Nick
That stuff’s bullshit, they’re all faking
it. And plus, your parents are gonna look
at the bill.
John Laggatorius
It shows up under a different name.
(beat)
I hope. Bang Bus.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
That wouldn’t look good. Maybe I should
just pick the one with the least dirty
sounding name.
Nick
Weapons of Ass Destruction’s out then.
John Laggatorius pulls up in front of a house.
John Laggatorius
I could tell my parents I’m doing a
project on Rome and I have to research
orgies.
3 EXT. Nick’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 3
Nick walks out his front door. WE REVEAL he is walking
towards John Laggatorius’s car.
Nick
(still into phone)
Yeah. Just tell them your taking a class
on blow jobs.
They both hang up and Nick gets in the car. John Laggatorius is about to
pull away, when Nick’S MOTHER comes out the front door.
Nick’S MOM
Thanks for taking him, John Laggatorius.
Nick changes the radio station. John Laggatorius slaps his hand.
John Laggatorius
Don’t touch that!
Nick’S MOM
You two are so funny. I can’t imagine
what you’ll do without each other next
year. Nick told me you didn’t get into
State.
John Laggatorius
Yeah, you know. I got some other places.
Good places. I think we’ll be fine.
Nick’S MOM
Are you going to miss each other?
Nick
Miss each other? No!
2.
2 CONTINUED: 2
John Laggatorius (CONT'D)
(CONTINUED)
John Laggatorius
That’s disgusting.
MOM
Bye, boys.
John Laggatorius and Nick drive off.
John Laggatorius
I am truly, truly jealous that you got to
suck on those tits when you were a baby.
Nick
Fuck you, man.
4 EXT. CLARK SECONDARY- SOON AFTER 4
They drive up to Clark Secondary. There is a giant sign that
reads “Seniors - Two Glorious Weeks Until Graduation”. John Laggatorius
turns into the STAFF parking lot.
5 INT/EXT. 7-11 STORE - MOMENTS LATER 5
John Laggatorius and Nick walk past a group of smokers, towards the 7-11.
Nick
You’re being an idiot, man. You really
shouldn’t park there.
John Laggatorius
Fuck it. I’m a senior about to graduate.
They should be suckin’ my balls. It’s the
least they can do for stealing three
years of my life.
They walk past DIMITRI (18, big Native American guy) as they
enter the store. Dimitri aggressively bumps his shoulder into
John Laggatorius.
Nick
What the hell’s wrong with Dimitri?
John Laggatorius
Oh, yeah dude, I forgot to tell you. I
knocked the fuckin’ shit out of him in
capture the flag last week.
Nick
Good! 9th Grade Camp he gave me whiplash
in “King of the Ring.” I fucking hate
that guy.
They go to the magazine rack and stare at a Maxim cover.
3.
3 CONTINUED: 3
(CONTINUED)
Nick (CONT’D)
Look at those nipples.
John Laggatorius
They’re like baby toes.
Nick
It’s not fair. I have to hide every
erection I get.
John Laggatorius
Sometimes I get boners so big I can’t
hide them. And then I get nervous and my
heart starts pounding, and it all just,
like, feeds my boner. It just becomes
this...thing...that’s attached to me. And
it won’t go away.
Nick
Just imagine if girls weren’t weirded out
by our boners and they actually wanted to
see ‘em, like this shit.
John Laggatorius
You know it’s been, like, a year and a
half since I’ve seen an actual human
female nipple. Besides my mom’s. I saw it
last month, and it was sick.
Nick
Holy shit. Liat was two years ago? I
guess so. She was insanely hot, though.
John Laggatorius
Exactly. Too hot. That’s what sucks.
Nick
How can that possibly suck? I’d be
fuckin’ psyched if I’d gotten with a girl
that hot. You got, like, two dozen
handjobs!
John Laggatorius
And three quarters of a blowjob, But that
was fuckin’ it. It was the peak of my assgettin’ career, and it happened way, way,
way too early.
Nick
You’re like Orson Welles.
4.
5 CONTINUED: 5
(CONTINUED)
John Laggatorius
Exactly! If I’d built up to it, I’d
probably at least be having steady sex
with a mediocre-looking girl at this
point. I honestly now see why Orson
Welles ate his fat ass to death.
Nick
You’ll have sex in college. Everyone
does. And if not, you’ll have the Bang
Bus.
John Laggatorius
But the key is to be good at sex by the
time you’re in college. You don’t want
girls to think you suck dick at fucking.
Nick
I still think you’ve got a chance with
Jules. She got mad hot over last summer,
and clearly hasn’t realized it, ‘cause
she still flirts with you.
John Laggatorius
Are you joking, man? Let’s see here...she
dated Dan Remick, Matt Muir, Josh Corber
and what’s-his-face. All of those were
cool guys. She’s been hot way longer than
you think. Why would she end her high
school career with me?
Nick
Well, Helen got with Ariel Shafir.
John Laggatorius
Yeah, and he was a complete fucking
loser. You’re a step up from that. Which
is why you should stop being a pussy and
do her! You could nailthe shit out of
her for, like, two months before you
leave. That bitch looks like a good
fucker.
Nick
Hey! I’m sick of you talking about her
like that, man!
Nick starts to walk out. John Laggatorius follows.
John Laggatorius
What, you can talk about that bitch all
day every single day, but I can’t say one
thing about her?
5.
5 CONTINUED: (2) 5
(CONTINUED
Nick
I don’t constantly insult her.
John Laggatorius
I didn’t insult her! I said she looks
like a good fucker! She looks like she
can take a dick. That’s a good thing.
Some women pride themselves on their dicktaking abilities.
6 EXT. 7-11 - CONTINUOUS 6
John Laggatorius and Nick come out the front doors. TERRY, one of the
rough-looking smokers, calls out.
TERRY
Yo. John Laggatorius. Did you hear I’m having the big
grad party?
Nick, a little scared, keeps his distance.
John Laggatorius
No.
TERRY
Yeah.
Terry spits on John Laggatorius’s shirt.
TERRY (CONT’D)
And you’re not coming. Tell your fucking
faggot friend he can’t come either.
John Laggatorius wipes the spit off. He looks at Terry and seems as
though he’s about to say something, but is interrupted when
Terry starts hocking up more spit. John Laggatorius runs away as Terry
and his friends laugh. He catches up to Nick and they head
back to school.
Nick
Wow. You really bitched out on that one.
John Laggatorius
I bitched out? You bitched out! You were
across the street before I even realized
what was going on.
(beat)
That guy’s such a douche bag.
7 EXT. CLARK SECONDARY OVAL RUNNING TRACK - DAY 7

5 CONTINUED: (3) 5
(CONTINUED)
BIRD’S EYE VIEW OF A P.E. CLASS
There are 30 guys standing behind the starting line of the
school’s track. We hear a TEACHER yell “Go!” and the boys
start running.
We FOLLOW them from above. All the boys keep pretty much the
same pace except for one runner who slowly lags behind. The
group gets so far ahead of the him that he is alone in the
frame. He stops.
CLOSE UP OF THE RUNNER:
Kneeling on the track breathing heavily. It’s John Laggatorius.
John Laggatorius
(panting)
This...is...bullshit.
A moment later a KID with prosthetic leg jogs by.
KID
(as he passes John Laggatorius)
Poo-say.
8 INT. CLARK SECONDARY CLASSROOM - DAY 8
Nick is sitting in math class staring at HELEN’S breasts.
She‘s a very tall girl and is athletic in a sexy way, wearing
volleyball team sweat pants and a tank top. He looks up from
her breasts to her face: she is staring right at him. He
immediately looks to the front of the class, embarrassed.
The bell rings and everyone leaves. Helen walks up to Nick as
they enter the hallway. He’s really nervous. She offers him a
pen.
HELEN
Hey Nick, thanks for the pen.
Nick
Oh, don’t worry, no worries. Just keep
it. Then you’ll just have it, and you
won’t have to borrow another pen.
HELEN
Thanks...uh...I was going to ask you, did
you hear about Terry’s grad party? It’s
going to be so insane.
Nick
Yeah, it’s a maybe. But, you know, I
gotta, I got my...
7.
7 CONTINUED: 7
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
there’s so much other fun shit that is
going to be going on that night...so, you
know...
HELEN
Fun shit? But I, like, never see you at
any parties or anything.
Nick
Because of all the other fun shit I’m off
doing.
HELEN
(playful)
Okay. So why weren’t you at Dimitri’s
party on Saturday?
Nick
Dimitri’s? I uh...didn’t want to go,
because, well, I did other stuff.
Saturday...
(nervous, he desperately
thinks)
Oh yeah! Saturday night was awesome!
(The real version of Nick’s story is shown through a montage
of quick flashbacks.)
Nick (CONT’D) (V.O)
First my parents went out to a double
feature, so a bunch of people came
over...
9 INT. Nick’S HOUSE - NIGHT 9
John Laggatorius is there. Nick and him are surfing the Bang Bus web
site. AtchisonL arrives with a bottle of Sambuca. Atchisonl is one
of those seniors who looks like he’s thirteen years old.
Nick
...and we had a couple drinks in my
basement...
An empty bottle of Sambuca in front of them and empty beer
cans at their feet, the three boys each shotgun a beer.
Nick (CONT’D) (V.O)
...and John Laggatorius’s parents were having this
cocktail party, and we went over there
to, like, mingle...
8.
8 CONTINUED: 8
Nick (CONT'D)
10 INT John Laggatorius’S HOUSE - NIGHT 10
John Laggatorius’s parents are having a fancy cocktail party. The boys
are drunk as hell.
Nick
...and there were actually some really
interesting and, like, entertaining
people there...
The boys laugh hysterically as they each shake Tobassco Sauce
onto their tongues. They writhe around in agony as several
adults look at them like they are morons.
Nick (CONT’D) (V.O.)
...and, uh, then we saw some, uh, live
music.
11 INT. John Laggatorius’S HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT 11
In John Laggatorius’s basement, the boys violently wrestle. Nick gives
Atchisonl a bloody nose, but they all can’t help but laugh.
Nick
...then we went to a club downtown...
12 EXT. STRIP CLUB - NIGHT 12
The bouncer of a dirty strip club rejects them.
Nick
...and then we pretty much called it a
night and went home...
13 INT. TBD HOUSE - NIGHT 13
Nick pukes all over John Laggatorius. Nick and Atchisonl laugh hysterically
as John Laggatorius yells at them.
14 INT. CLARK SECONDARY HALLWAY - DAY 14
We return to Nick talking to Helen in the halls.
Nick
...you would’ve loved it.
HELEN
That sounds so fun. I would love to go do
something like that.
9.
(CONTINUED)
Nick
Yeah...well, you know, me and John Laggatorius are
always cooking up...uh...fun
little...events.
Helen is disappointed in his response.
HELEN
So, are you guys going to the same school
next year?
Nick
Nah. We were going to but, uh, we got
into different ones.
HELEN
What are you going to do without him?
Nick
Same shit I’ve always been doing. It’ll
be fine. Don’t worry about it. I’m not.
15 INT. FOODS AND NUTRITION ROOM - NEXT PERIOD 15
Students file into the home economics room. The blackboard
reads, TODAY: TIRAMISU. The ingredients are listed below.
John Laggatorius is talking to the cooking teacher.
John Laggatorius
Mrs. Grier, I joined this class because I
thought I’d be cooking with a partner.
It’s not fair. She’s never here. I don’t
get twice the marks for doing all the
work.
MRS. GREIR
I didn’t invent odd numbers, John Laggatorius.
John Laggatorius
Look at Nick.
Nick is playfully throwing flour at a tiny Japanese boy. They
both laugh hard.
John Laggatorius (CONT’D)
While I’m over in my unit, isolated and
alone, eating my terrible-tasting food
because I can’t even properly mix
ingredients by myself, I gotta look over
at that.
10.
14 CONTINUED: 14
(CONTINUED)
The Japanese boy ties Nick’s apron. Nick then turns around
and ties the boy’s apron. They both look happy.
John Laggatorius (CONT’D)
I wash and dry. And that is B.S. I’m like
a single mother.
MRS. GREIR
Well, save it for next week. Today Jules’
partner isn’t here either. Pair up with
her. Station four.
John Laggatorius
Jules?
The teacher walks away. John Laggatorius looks over to station four,
nervous as hell.
ANGLE ON: Jules, well-dressed and “popular” looking. She
stands alone at station four, laying out utensils.
John Laggatorius musters his courage and walks towards Jules. He stops,
unsure of what to say.
JULES
Hey John Laggatorius, your partner didn’t come again?
John Laggatorius
That’s kind of a personal question.
JULES
What?
John Laggatorius
(nervous)
Nothing. It was my attempt at humour.
JULES
Well, uh, maybe I kidnapped her so you’d
be forced to work with me. There’s my
attempt at humour.
John Laggatorius
Well, I would call that a success.
(reading recipe sheet)
Marscampone... scamponee cheese? Is that
some kind of new cheese or something?
JULES
All cheese tastes the same to me anyway.
John Laggatorius
Except blue cheese. That stuff is sick.
11.
15 CONTINUED: 15
(CONTINUED)
JULES
Thank you! Yes! My older brother always
eats blue cheese. You know that stuff is
actually moldy. Like, they tell you it’s
moldy, then they tell you to eat it
anyway.
John Laggatorius
Well whoever “they” are, they can eat my
dick.
16 INT. FOODS AND NUITRITION ROOM - LATER 16
Jules watches as John Laggatorius awkwardly removes the tiramisu from the
oven and places it on the table.
JULES
What are you doing tonight?
John Laggatorius
I don’t know, probably nothing. Why?
JULES
My parents are out of town and I’m
thinking of having a party. I don’t know
how big it’ll be, but you should come
anyways.
John Laggatorius
Yeah. Sure. That sounds fun. I love
parties.
JULES
Really? I don’t usually see you at them.
John Laggatorius
Oh, uh. It’s more of, like, a love-hate
thing. Right now I love them, though.
Uh...how do I do this?
JULES
I’ll write down my address and number.
ANGLE ON: Nick.
Nick is standing by the sink scrubbing a tray. Behind him, at
the table, is the small Japanese boy eating the tiramisu.
Nick
That’s good shit. Huh, Miroki?
John Laggatorius walks up to Nick.
12.
15 CONTINUED: (2) 15
(CONTINUED)
John Laggatorius
(whispering)
Dude! She’s havin’ a fuckin’ party.
ANGLE ON: Atchisonl entering the room
John Laggatorius (CONT’D)
(whispering)
Don’t tell Atchisonl about the party.
AtchisonL
Hey guys, I was walking here, and on the
way, I saw Nicola, and she was wearing
these tight white pants and a black gstring and you could see it right through
the pants.
17 INT. HALLWAY (FLASHBACK) - EARLIER 17
We see Atchisonl, looking at the ass of NICOLA, an incredibly
hot girl who exudes sexual vibes and looks a little skanky;
you can see her black g-string through her tight white pants.
She turns and notices Atchisonl. He gives an awkward look.
AtchisonL
It’s nine thirty.
 NICOLA
What?
18 INT. FOODS AND NUITRITION ROOM (PRESENT) - CONTINUOUS 18
Back to Atchisonl, John Laggatorius and Nick.
AtchisonL
I told her what time it was. It was
awesome. She’s got the nicest ass.
John Laggatorius
Like you’d know what to do with it.
AtchisonL
Ha ha. I’m really gonna miss your kneeslappers when me and Nick are at State.
John Laggatorius
(pissed)
Yeah, well I’ll be at Junior college
where the girls are half as smart, and
thus twice as likely to blow me.
AtchisonL
What are you guys doing tonight?
13.
16 CONTINUED: 16
(CONTINUED)
John Laggatorius
Nothing. Sorry. You’ll just have to
fingerbang yourself.
Nick
(to Atchisonl)
What you doing?
AtchisonL
Well, John Laggatorius always said I was too much of
a pussy, but he was wrong. It’s been
arranged. At lunch, I’m going to the same
place Mike Snider went to pick up my
brand new false identification card.
John Laggatorius
Dude! That’s perfect, ‘cause, Nick,
didn’t you just say that you heard about
a party?
AtchisonL
(to Nick)
Why didn’t you tell me?
John Laggatorius
Shut up. Who cares? Just be happy he
told. And hey! Now you can buy the booze.
AtchisonL
Sounds cool. Cool.
MRS. GREIR (O.S.)
If you’re not in this class, leave this
class!
Nick
Well done, man. We’ll see you after
class.
Atchisonl leaves.
John Laggatorius
Did you tell that nimrod you’re not going
to room with him?
Nick
Uh...no, not yet.
John Laggatorius
You better, man. That guy is a poon-tang
repellent.
John Laggatorius sees Jules coming.
14.
18 CONTINUED: 18
(CONTINUED)
JULES
John Laggatorius, dishes time. What’s the hold up?
John Laggatorius
We’re getting a fake ID.
JULES
Well, you two have four more years to
cuddle, so let’s get to work.
Nick
Actually, we’re going to different
schools.
JULES
Really? You’re cutting the cord? What’s
going to happen?
John Laggatorius
Nothing! Jesus.
Nick
Yeah? What do people think is gonna
happen? That’s what I don’t get.
John Laggatorius
We’re not, like, dependent on each other.
Nick
We met when we were 8, we were fine
before then. It’s not like we do
everything together.
19 INT. CLARK SECONDARY CAFETERIA - DAY 19
John Laggatorius and Nick are eating together.
Nick
So it looks like we get a little
graduation party after all.
John Laggatorius
I would do terrible things to get with
Jules tonight. Terrible things.
Nick
No shit. I’d give my left foot to start
dating Helen. She’s killin’ me.
John Laggatorius
Ah, Helen’s a bitch.
Nick slams his fist on the table.
15.
18 CONTINUED: (2) 18
(CONTINUED)
Nick
I’m fuckin’ sick of this shit, man!
Seriously. Why do you hate her? Is there
even an actual reason? Because seriously,
I’m beginning you think you like her.
John Laggatorius
Hell no! I hate her.
Nick
Why?
John Laggatorius
I was never going to tell you this story,
because I knew that if you heard it you
would never want to get with Helen, but
over the last few weeks I’ve been having
a hard time thinking of a reason not to.
So, here it is. Helen and I went to
elementary school together, right?
(beat)
Well, in the third grade, I
had...like...an odd problem. For some
reason, I don’t know why, I used to have
this thing...where I would...like,
kinda...sit around all day and draw
pictures of dicks.
Nick
What?
20 INT/EXT VARIOUS LOCATIONS 20
A MONTAGE of FLASHBACKS of YOUNG John Laggatorius (Age 10) drawing
pictures of dicks in various places. A PARK, AT HOME, IN A
SANDBOX, and finally, in a SCHOOL CLASSROOM.
John Laggatorius (V.O.)
I’d just sit there for hours on end
drawing dicks. I don’t know what it was.
I couldn’t touch the pen to paper without
it drawing a penis.
Nick (V.O.)
That’s fucked.
John Laggatorius (V.O.)
No shit that’s fucked up. Here I am this
little kid who can’t stop drawing dicks
to save his life.
16.

21 INT. CLARK SECONDARY CAFETERIA -PRESENT 21
Nick
What does that have to do with Helen?
John Laggatorius
Just listen.
22 INT. RANDOLPH ELEMENTARY CLASSROOM -FLASHBACK 22
Young John Laggatorius is still sitting at his desk drawing penises.
John Laggatorius (V.O.)
I was very secretive about this dick
thing I had going, after all, even I
thought I was a loon, lord knows what
other people would have thought. So I
would take all my dick drawings and stick
them in this Muppet lunch-box I had.
We see Young John Laggatorius sticking a picture of a penis in a lunchbox filled with pieces of paper.
23 INT. RANDOLPH ELEMENTARY CLASSROOM - DAY 23
Young John Laggatorius is drawing, however it is a different day.
John Laggatorius (V.O.)
So one day I was finishing up a picture
of a real big and veiny bastard, when all
of a sudden...
Young John Laggatorius drops the picture of the dick off his desk. It
floats down and hits the feet of a cute little girl, YOUNG
HELEN.
24 INT. CLARK SECONDARY CAFETERIA - PRESENT 24
Nick
You hit Helen’s foot with your dick?
25 INT. RANDOLPH ELEMENTARY CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER 25
The little girl picks up the picture and looks at it with a
truly disturbed look on her face. Young John Laggatorius grabs the
picture from her and shoves it into his lunch-box.
26 INT. CLARK SECONDARY CAFETERIA - PRESENT 26
John Laggatorius
Well she fucking flipped. She started
crying and shit. Ratted me out.

The principle finds my cock-Muppet lunchbox, and he fucking flips.
27 INT. RANDOLPH ELEMENTARY PRINCIPLE’S OFFICE - DAY 27
A FLASHBACK of Young John Laggatorius sitting in the principle's office.
The Muppet lunch-box is open and the penis drawings are
completely covering his desk.
John Laggatorius (V.O.)
It turns out the principle was some crazy
religious guy and he thought I was
possessed by some dick devil or
something.
The principal puts his hand on John Laggatorius’s head and begins praying
for his soul.
28 INT. CLARK SECONDARY CAFETERIA - PRESENT 28
John Laggatorius
So, he calls my parents and they make me
go to a psychologist who kept asking me
all these dick questions. My parents
wouldn’t even let me eat dick-shaped
foods for, like, months! No carrots, no
Pop-sicles, no hot-dogs. You know how
many fucking foods are shaped like dick?
Nick
(half amazed, half amused)
Wow. That’s really messed up.
John Laggatorius
I can’t even stand to look at her punk
face.
(beat)
I’m going to go take a piss. Peace.
29 INT. CLARK SECONDARY BATHROOM - LATER 29
John Laggatorius finishes his piss. He goes over to the sink, looks at it
for a moment, then walks out of the bathroom.
30 INT. CLARK SECONDARY HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 30
Just as John Laggatorius turns the corner he sees Jules, Nicola, and
SHIRLEY standing by their lockers. Jules spots John Laggatorius.
JULES
John Laggatorius. There you are.
Jules turns and says goodbye to Nicola, who walks away. Jules
and Shirley turn to meet John Laggatorius.

John Laggatorius
Hey. Here I am.
JULES
So you’re coming to my party, right? It’s
fully on.
John Laggatorius
Yeah. Why? Should I not?
JULES
No, no, no. I really want you to come.
But...uh, you did say you were getting a
fake ID or something, is that right?
John Laggatorius
Very right. Right. I’m getting that.
SHIRLEY
Can you get us drinks?
John Laggatorius
Ummm... I don’t know. I... think...maybe.
JULES
(half joking)
Come on, you scratch our backs, we’ll
scratch yours.
John Laggatorius
Well, funny thing about my back. It’s
located on my cock.
Shirley is offended. Jules laughs a little. John Laggatorius laughs too
hard.
John Laggatorius (CONT’D)
Ha! Alright, sure. I can do that. What do
you guys want?
JULES
Well, this is actually, like, a big
favor, but, well, my parents gave me like
a hundred bucks to feed myself for the
week, but the house if full of food, so I
figure I should just spend all of it on
extra drinks for the party.
John Laggatorius
Wow. I would never even think of doing
something that nice.
Jules hands John Laggatorius a hundred dollars.
19.
30 CONTINUED: 30

JULES
Well, this is really nice of you. I mean,
I really appreciate this.
John Laggatorius can’t believe what he’s hearing. He can barely contain
his smile.
John Laggatorius
Should I just get, like, a shitload of
different shit?
JULES
Whatever shit you think people would
like, I don’t really know.
SHIRLEY
I want Mike’s Hard Lemonade.
JULES
Okay. I’ll see you tonight.
John Laggatorius
Yeah! I’ll see you!
The girls walk off, leaving John Laggatorius lost in thought. He suddenly
runs down the hall.
31 EXT. SCHOOL FIELD - MOMENTS LATER 31
Nick is standing alone amidst the rest of his gym class as
they play soccer.
GYM TEACHER
Nick, get into the game.
Nick says nothing and the teacher soon redirects his
attention elsewhere. Nick sees John Laggatorius jogging towards him.
John Laggatorius
(out of breath, worked up)
Man, just - Nick, listen to me. You know
Jules? You know what she just did? She
came up to me and asked me if I would buy
her alcohol. Not just her, her whole
party. Do you know what that means? It
means that by some miracle, we were
paired up, we talked, and she actually
thought of me afterwards. Thought of me
enough to decide that I was the guy that
she was going to trust the fun-ness of
her party with. She wants me! She fucking
wants my dick!
20.

Nick
Did you ever think maybe she’s just using
you to get her alcohol?
John Laggatorius
Of course I thought of that! LISTEN TO
THIS!
32 INT. FOODS AND NUITRITION ROOM (FLASHBACK) 32
The same scene as before with John Laggatorius and Jules in class.
JULES
Yeah! My older brother always eats blue
cheese. You know that stuff is actually
moldy.
33 EXT. SCHOOL FIELD - PRESENT 33
John Laggatorius
She has an older brother! She could have
asked him, but she asked me! She looked
me straight in the face and asked me. She
wants to fuck me, man. Do you understand
that? Fucking! Today is the day that
fucking has become possible.
Nick
Are you stupid? You’re not going to be
able to sleep with her tonight.
John Laggatorius
She’s going to be at the party, she’s
gonna be drunk, and she likes me at least
a little, so I can get with her. Then, I
make her my girlfriend, and then I fuck
her all summer long! Then, by the time
college rolls around, I’m the fuckin’
fucking master, man!
Nick
Make her your girlfriend? Of course!
That’s good. So, hypnosis, love potion,
or mind-control helmet?
John Laggatorius
Once I’ve gotten with her, I write her
love letters, flowers, I’ll do anything -
I’ll be the most pussy-whipped guy in the
universe - what chick wouldn’t go out
with a guy like that?
21.
31 CONTINUED: 31
(CONTINUED)
The soccer ball rolls towards them. They both watch as it
rolls by.
CLASSMATE
What the hell, Nick?
Nick shrugs back.
CLASSMATE (CONT’D)
Fuck you, man.
John Laggatorius
Fuck off, Greg. Why don’t you piss your
pants again?
CLASSMATE
That was, like, eight years ago, asshole!
He runs off.
John Laggatorius
(to Nick)
Wanna hear the best part?
Nick
(sarcastic)
Oh, I haven’t?
John Laggatorius
Helen!
Nick looks upset, assuming that John Laggatorius is about to trash-talk
Helen, as usual.
John Laggatorius (CONT’D)
You do the same thing, man! Buy Helen her
alcohol. Then, tonight, when you guys are
both drunk, get with her! This is the
last party we’re ever going to go to as
high school people! I’ve fully ignored my
hatred for Helen in coming up with this,
which is a big ass deal. We need to stop
being pussy and for once just goes balls
out, man!
Nick seems to be swayed.
Nick
I should get Helen alcohol?
John Laggatorius
Of course! It’ll be pimp, and then you
know she’ll be drunk.
22.
33 CONTINUED: 33
(CONTINUED)
Nick
Have you talked to Atchisonl?
John Laggatorius
You talk to Helen, I’ll find that retard
Atchisonl.
34 INT. HALLWAY - LATER 34
Everyone is rushing to class. Nick hurries through the halls
and finds Helen at her locker.
Nick
Hey Helen! Hold up. Did you hear about
the party tonight?
HELEN
Yeah, I just heard. It sounds sweet.
You’re not coming, are you?
Nick
No, no, I am. That’s why I came looking
for you. Me and some guys are going to
the liquor store after class, so I was
thinking I could buy you yours, if you
needed someone to.
HELEN
Yeah! That’d be great, that’d save me
such a hassle, cause I was going to beg
my sister, but yeah, could you get me,
like, a bottle of Goldschlager? I’ll pay
you back tonight.
Nick
You will absolutely not. It’s my treat.
HELEN
Wow. Thanks, Nick.
Nick swings a friendly little punch at Helen’s shoulder, but
someone walks into him, causing him to nail her in directly
in the tit!
HELEN (CONT’D)
Hey! You punched my tit!
Nick
(mortified)
I’m sorry! Shit, shit. I’m so sorry! I
just wanted to give you a friendly nudge
in the arm, you know? I’m so sorry.
23.
33 CONTINUED: (2) 33
(CONTINUED)
HELEN
(giggling)
Don’t worry about it. So I’ll see you at
the party?
Nick
Yeah. I’ll see you then. I’m so sorry
about that.
35 EXT. CLARK SECONDARY - CONTINUOUS 35
John Laggatorius is waiting angrily in front of the school. Nick comes
out the front doors.
John Laggatorius
That douche bag isn’t back yet, I’ve been
standing here with my thumb up my ass.
Nick
I did it, dude. I even offered to pay for
it. It was pimp.
John Laggatorius
Whoa. That is fucking pimp. Why didn’t I
do that? Shit.
The bell rings.
36 INT. WOODSHOP CLASS - CONTINUOUS 36
John Laggatorius and Nick work side by side in the woodshop.
John Laggatorius
(yelling over the machines)
That’s what we get for trusting a mental
midget! He’s fucking it all up! I bet he
pussied out, just like I said he would!
37 EXT. CLARK SECONDARY - AFTER SCHOOL 37
John Laggatorius and Nick walk out the front door.
John Laggatorius
I mean, what are we going to tell the
girls? “Sorry, we couldn’t do what we
promised because we’re dickless
incompetents!” We’ll never get laid
because of that little ass-fuck. How did
he get in to State?! He’s got shit for
brains! Shit! How else can we get liquor?
AtchisonL (O.S.)
Hey guys!
24.
34 CONTINUED: 34
(CONTINUED)
John Laggatorius and Nick turn around to see Atchisonl running after them.
Nick
Where have you been?
John Laggatorius
Yeah! You almost gave me a goddamn heart
attack! You better fucking have it, where
is it?
AtchisonL
I got it. It’s flawless! It’s great, man,
look.
Atchisonl reaches into his pocket and pulls out the fake ID.
Nick grabs it.
Nick
(reading the card)
Okay Mr...”McLovin”? What kind of a
stupid name is that? What are you
trying to be, an Irish R&B singer?
AtchisonL
Well, they let you pick any name you want
when you get there.
John Laggatorius
So you picked McLovin?
AtchisonL
It was between that or Muhammad.
John Laggatorius
Why was it between that or Muhammad? Why
didn’t you just pick a common name?
AtchisonL
Actually, John Laggatorius, Muhammad is the most
commonly used name on earth.
Nick
Have you ever actually met a guy named
Muhammad?
AtchisonL
Have you actually ever met a guy named
McLovin?
John Laggatorius
No! That’s why you picked a bad name.
25.
37 CONTINUED: 37
(CONTINUED)
Nick
You probably have federal agents tracking
you for even considering the name
Muhammad on a fake ID!
John Laggatorius
Look at this shit man, you don’t even
have a first name. It just says “NAME:
MCLOVIN”
Nick
One name?
AtchisonL
I just thought McLovin sounded old, and
the chicks would dig it.
Nick
Under what circumstances would you ever
have to show a chick your ID?
AtchisonL
She could ask. Or, I could just show it
to her.
John Laggatorius
Holy shit! I don’t believe this. This
says you’re fucking 25! Why didn’t you
just put 21?
AtchisonL
I knew you would ask that. Look, every
day, dozens of kids roll into the liquor
store with fake ID’s trying to act like
Joe Casual. Each and every one of these
kids just so happens to be 21 years old.
Just how many 21 year-olds do you think
there are?
John Laggatorius
Fool!
Nick
Calm down! It’s not terrible! This might
work, but it’s up to you, Atchisonl. They’ll
either think, “Oh, it’s another punk kid
with a fake ID.” Or, “Look, it’s McLovin,
the twenty five year-old organ donor”.
What’s it gonna be?
Atchisonl takes a deep breath.
26.
37 CONTINUED: (2) 37
(CONTINUED)
AtchisonL
I am McLovin.
John Laggatorius
You’re not McLovin. No one’s McLovin and
this is never going to work. We need a
new way to get alcohol. Could we drive to
Canada or something?
AtchisonL
I still think it’s going to work.
They walk into the staff parking lot. John Laggatorius stops.
John Laggatorius
What the fuck? Where’s my car?
Nick
I told you, man! What did I say? I told
you that was a dumb idea.
AtchisonL
Why would you park in the staffJohn Laggatorius
Shut up, Atchisonl.
AtchisonL
‘Cause you’re not staff.
John Laggatorius
I am aware of that, Fagell.
John Laggatorius storms off. Nick follows him.
AtchisonL
(yelling)
Will you still pick me up from work?
Nick and John Laggatorius round the corner, leaving Atchisonl behind.
John Laggatorius
Let’s go to your house.
38 INT. Nick’S BEDROOM - SOON AFTER 38
John Laggatorius puts on a shirt that is way too small and he’s wearing
pants that are too tight. Nick is playing the video game
Grand Theft Auto.
27.
37 CONTINUED: (3) 37
(CONTINUED)
John Laggatorius
Now we wait for your Mom to piss off and
steal your parents’ booze like your
brother always does. Take a bit from
every bottle. Piece of cake. It’s not
exactly what Jules wanted, but it’ll do,
right?
Nick
Come on! Just wear what you wore to
school.
John Laggatorius
I told you I can’t do that. I can’t let
Jules see me in the same shit I wore at
school. It’s completely unbecoming.
Nick
Why don’t you just go to your house and
get your own clothes? ‘Cause this is
stupid.
John Laggatorius
You’re stupid! I can’t go home. Then my
mom will know the car got towed and I’ll
be grounded tonight. I’ll just stay here
all weekend and pick it up on Monday.
Nick
(RE: video game)
Where the fuck is the dirt bike?
(beat)
Ah, screw it. I’m just gonna kill
everyone. Boom! Die, piggies!!!
John Laggatorius
Don’t you have bigger clothes?
Nick
See what my dad’s got.
39 INT. Nick’S HOUSE - PARENTS ROOM - SOON AFTER 39
John Laggatorius is wearing Nick’s Dad’s clothes: a 70s style cowboy
shirt, just barely pulling it off, as well as slacks.
John Laggatorius
Not bad, eh?
Nick
It’s, like, 7:30 and my Mom’s still here.
28.
38 CONTINUED: 38
(CONTINUED)
John Laggatorius
Alright, here’s what we’ll do. I’ll fuck
your Mom in the basement while you steal
the liquor.
Nick
Fuck you, asshole. Let’s just sneak down
there and grab it.
40 INT. Nick’S HOUSE - LATER 40
Nick and John Laggatorius, carrying an empty two liter bottle of Coke,
cautiously descend the creaking staircase. Their eyes watch
the TV room, where Nick’s mom is on the phone. The boys enter
the dining room and cautiously open the liquor cabinet. John Laggatorius
enthusiastically reaches for a bottle.
John Laggatorius
(whispering)
Alright, dude. Get ready to receive.
Nick begins unscrewing his bottle, when he notices a little
black line marking where the liquor bottle is filled to.
Then, he realizes that every bottle has it.
Nick
(whispering)
I can’t believe it. They marked them.
John Laggatorius
(whispering)
What do you mean they...oh, man! Your
parents are fuckers. What do we do now?
Nick
(whispering)
Shh!!! We...we...take some and fill it
back up with water. Get ready, I’ll get
water.
Nick hurries off. John Laggatorius looks at the liquor cabinet, trying to
choose the best booze. He grabs a massive bottle of gin. Nick
reappears.
Nick (CONT’D)
(whispering)
Gin? That stuff is literally undrinkable.
John Laggatorius
(whispering)
It’s the biggest bottle, you douche. Just
do it! She’s right in the other room!
29.
39 CONTINUED: 39
(CONTINUED)
Nick reluctantly holds an empty Coke bottle as John Laggatorius shakily
pours the gin in. Nick starts refilling the gin bottle with
water, when suddenly they both hear his mom coming.
Nick
(whispering)
Run!
John Laggatorius
(whispering)
But, the booze?
Nick
(whispering)
Take it!
John Laggatorius runs off with the gin and Coke bottle. Nick quickly
closes the cabinet and sneaks off right before his mom
enters. Through the window she see’s that John Laggatorius is already on
the front lawn and thinks nothing of it.
Nick (CONT’D)
Bye, Mom! Love you.
Nick’S MOM
Love you, sweety.
Nick leaves.
41 EXT. Nick’S HOUSE - FRONT LAWN 41
Nick and John Laggatorius triumphantly walk away. John Laggatorius holds up the gin.
John Laggatorius
Look at this mother. Smell it’s glory.
He opens it up and takes a whiff.
John Laggatorius (CONT’D)
Mmm. It’s good. Barely a scent.
He takes a crazy big swig.
John Laggatorius (CONT’D)
See that? I always said I had the highest
alcohol tolerance. I’m like Superman.
John Laggatorius taste another swig, but makes a strange face. Nick grabs
the bottle and takes a swig.
Nick
It’s fucking water!
30.
40 CONTINUED: 40
(CONTINUED)
John Laggatorius
Water?
(drinks again)
Fuck. Your brother beat us to the punch.
We have to go back!
Nick
We can’t go back! She totally knew,
she’ll bust us for sure, and we have to
meet Atchisonl.
John Laggatorius
Well, fuck...fine. Text your brother he’s
a stupid piece of crap.
Nick pulls out his cell and chuckles as he types.
42 EXT. SHOPWELLS - DUSK 42
Nick and John Laggatorius walk off the bus. They see Atchisonl walking
towards them. He’s in his uniform holding a hanger with a
shirt and a vest.
John Laggatorius
What the hell is that?
AtchisonL
A vest.
John Laggatorius
You’re gonna look like a Pinocchio.
Nick
What? It’s just a vest.
AtchisonL
Yeah. How many high schoolers you see in
vests?
John Laggatorius
(eyeing Shopwell’s)
You know, they got a ton of liquor right
in there. If we get it now we can get to
the party faster with all of Jules’ shit.
AtchisonL
No way! I work there. They know I’m not
twenty-five.
John Laggatorius
Nobody said anything about you, dickmouth. You have one name on your ID. It’s
out of the equation!
31.
41 CONTINUED: 41
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
And now I’m gonna have to take drastic
measures. I’m gonna steal the booze.
AtchisonL
What?! No! Hell no! You can’t do that!
Nick
(mocking)
Yeah, right!
John Laggatorius
That’s right. And that way I give Jules
back her money, like you did with Helen.
That was good thinking, that’s fucking
pimp. That’s how you seal a deal. It
won’t be hard. Remember Dan Vertlieb
stole a keg from here and he’s got, like,
really bad scoliosis!
Nick
You’re not gonna steal it. Atchisonl, he’s
not going to steal it.
AtchisonL
Please. Don’t do this! I promise. I’ll
get the liquor later.
John Laggatorius
I’m stepping up. And once I’m up, I don’t
step back down. Maybe you “State” boys
don’t understand that.
John Laggatorius walks to the store.
43 INT. SHOPWELL’S - CONTINUOUS 43
John Laggatorius enters the store, looking determined. He spots a
SECURITY GUARD standing by one of the registers.
John Laggatorius
(to himself)
Hope piggy can run.
He walks past the registers, which brings him in front of the
long liquor aisle. He surveys the scene. There is an OLD
WOMAN browsing the shelves. John Laggatorius looks over to the registers.
44 INT. SHOPWELL’S (FANTASY) - EVENING 44
John Laggatorius is at the cash register. He has a huge amount of booze
in the conveyor belt.
CASHIER
How old are you?

John Laggatorius (CONT'D)
(CONTINUED)
John Laggatorius
Twenty two.
CASHIER
You certainly are. That’ll be eighty
dollars.
John Laggatorius hands the cashier a big EIGHTY DOLLAR BILL.
John Laggatorius
Thank you kindly.
CASHIER
You’re welcome, John Laggatorius.
45 INT. SHOPWELL’S - CONTINUOUS 45
John Laggatorius, still standing in front of the liquor aisle, shakes his
head. He eyeballs the old lady.
46 INT. SHOPWELL’S (FANTASY) - EVENING 46
The old lady is browsing. She drops her big purse. A hand
reaches down and picks it up. It’s John Laggatorius.
John Laggatorius
Excuse me, ma’am. You dropped your purse.
Would you like me to help you to your
car?
OLD LADY
That would be lovely, young man. Would
you like me to buy you alcohol?
John Laggatorius
That would be lovely!
47 EXT. SHOPWELL’S (FANTASY) - MOMENTS LATER 47
John Laggatorius, holding two huge bags of liquor, waves to the Old Lady
as she drives away.
John Laggatorius
Enjoy your remaining years!
OLD LADY
I will. Enjoy fucking Jules!
48 INT. SHOPWELL’S (FANTASY) - CONTINUOUS 48
John Laggatorius shakes his head. He looks down the aisle again, takes a
breath and starts walking.
33.
44 CONTINUED: 44
(CONTINUED)
He arrives at a fancy looking bottle. He takes it and looks
down at it in his hands. A big golden label reads,
“GOLDSCHLAGER.”
SECURITY GAURD (O.S.)
Don’t do it kid.
We see that the Security Guard is right behind him. John Laggatorius
doesn’t look up, he just stares at the bottle dramatically.
John Laggatorius
I never had a choice.
He throws the bottle at the guards face. The guard blocks it
with his billy club, grabs another bottle, and hurls it at
John Laggatorius. John Laggatorius dodges it by an inch; the bottle hits the OLD LADY
in the head.
OLD LADY
(in agony)
AAAHHHHH!!!
Before John Laggatorius can do anything, the guard smashes a 40-ounce
bottle of beer across his face. The guard SWINGS the broken
end of the bottle and cuts John Laggatorius’s throat. Blood spurts out.
John Laggatorius drops his bottles and falls to the ground.
49 EXT. SHOPWELL’S - CONTINUOUS 49
Nick and Atchisonl are talking.
AtchisonL
Oh, and, uh, my Mom said we can have the
TV from her basement and I’ve got, like,
three lava-lamps and one strobe light, so
like, we can have that in the roomNick sees John Laggatorius coming out of Shopwell’s.
Nick
Shh. John Laggatorius’s coming.
AtchisonL
You still didn’t tell him we’re roomingNick
No. Shut up.
AtchisonL
(to John Laggatorius)
So, where’s all the stolen liquor?
34.
48 CONTINUED: 48
(CONTINUED)
John Laggatorius
Fuck you! I was gonna do it, but security
was tight as shit. I was gonna do it
though, don’t think I wasn’t. Let’s go to
the liquor store and try your stupid ID.
John Laggatorius heads towards the bus stop.
AtchisonL
Wait! I’m gonna put my vest back in my
locker!
50 INT. BUS - MOMENTS LATER 50
MORE MIND-BLOWINGLY BADASS FUNK MUSIC OVER John Laggatorius, Nick and
Atchisonl sitting on the bus amidst a bunch of gloomy,
unpleasant looking strangers. Nothing happens whatsoever.
51 EXT. LIQUOR STORE - EVENING 51
The bus stops in front of the liquor store and the guys get
out.
Nick
Well, here we are. Atchisonl, are you ready?
John Laggatorius
Here’s the list.
AtchisonL
A list? Why?
John Laggatorius
We’re getting girls their booze so
they’ll get with us. I put a lot of
thought into that list. It’s the perfect
party bar, so don’t mess it up and get
Sambuca again.
Atchisonl reads the list. A worried look sweeps across his face.
AtchisonL
Ouzo, Drambuie, Jager, Gold-shlay-gerNick
Goldschlager. That’s for Helen, so do not
forget it.
AtchisonL
-Alize, Captain Morgan Rum, Smirnoff
Rasberry and a big ass bottle of Popov35.
49 CONTINUED: 49
(CONTINUED)
John Laggatorius
Oh yeah, and Mike’s Hard Lemonade.
AtchisonL
This is too much. I can’t get away with
this much!
Nick
What’s the difference?
John Laggatorius hands Atchisonl the money.
AtchisonL
I don’t know, man. I’m getting, like,
really nervous.
Atchisonl starts breathing very hard and making an ODD NOISE
while doing so.
Nick
Are you okay?
John Laggatorius
What the hell are you doing?
AtchisonL
I don’t know if I want to do this.
John Laggatorius
What are you talking about? You just
promised you would. What is this shit?
AtchisonL
What if they turn me down?
John Laggatorius
Then we’re in the same place that we’re
in right now!
AtchisonL
It’s fucking humiliating! Everyone in the
store sees them kicking me out. What if
they make me put all the liquor back on
the shelf? I can’t do that!
John Laggatorius
This whole thing is bigger than you,
asshead! Just go in there and buy the
damn alcohol!
AtchisonL
What if I don’t feel like it anymore?
36.
51 CONTINUED: 51
(CONTINUED)
John Laggatorius
Then I will kill you! How’s that? If you
don’t buy the alcohol, I will kill you!
AtchisonL
Killing me won’t get you any alcohol,
jerkoff! I’m the one with the ID!
John Laggatorius
Then I will kill you, cut off your ugly
face, put it over mine, and buy it my
fucking self.
AtchisonL
You don’t have the technology or the
steady hands to pull off a procedure like
that!
John Laggatorius stands for a moment, then suddenly rushes Atchisonl. Nick
stands between them and breaks it up.
Nick
John Laggatorius, calm down! Atchisonl, stop being a
baby and go buy the alcohol! You said
you’d do it, so do it. It’s why you
bought the ID, so just go do it.
AtchisonL
(beat)
I’ll try.
Atchisonl walks into the store.
52 INT. LIQUOR STORE - CONTINUOUS 52
At first it all seems overwhelming. Atchisonl is confused,
dizzy, and sweating. He steps behind a large beer display and
takes a few deep breaths.
CLERK
Hi there.
Atchisonl flinches, shocked someone spoke to him. He keeps
walking. He nears a mother and her 17 year old SON. As Atchisonl
passes them, the son seems to recognize him. Atchisonl clearly
recognizes the son. Their eyes meet. Atchisonl looks in the
opposite direction.
SON
Atchisonl?
37.
51 CONTINUED: (2) 51

AtchisonL
(weird voice, covering his
face)

here?
AtchisonL
(weird voice)
Uh...nothing. Not Atchisonl...
(whisper)
Shut up, Moscovitch. You don’t know me.
MOSCOVITCH
(knowingly)
Oh, oh. Cool, cool. Good luck.
He puts his head down and quickly walks away. He arrives at
the beer and cooler section. Clearly intimidated, he slowly
opens a beer fridge. He grabs one beer attached to a six-pack
and pulls it forward. The beer comes loose in his hand as the
other five fall to the ground, cracking on impact, and
spraying beer all over the place. Atchisonl scrambles to stop
the beers from spraying, but soon finds that it is
impossible.
AtchisonL
Fuck.
A CLERK approaches Atchisonl.
CLERK
Is there a problem, sir?
AtchisonL
Umm, nope, no problem whatsoever.
CLERK
(pointing to the beer on the
floor)
Sir, did you do this? On the floor?
AtchisonL
(beat)
No.
(beat)
I think it happened before.
Atchisonl is standing in a puddle of beer with beer sprayed all
over his legs, holding a can of beer.

52 CONTINUED: 52

CLERK
Are you sure?
AtchisonL
I think I would know, thank you.
Atchisonl walks away.
53 INT. LIQUOR STORE - LATER 53
Atchisonl has a shopping cart filled with booze. He gets in line
to pay. He looks ahead to the OLD-LOOKING GUY (35) who is
currently at the CASHIER (woman) paying.
CASHIER
Um, yes, may I please see some ID?
OLD-LOOKING GUY
No problem. Heh. I haven’t been ID-ed in
years.
CASHIER
Anyone who looks under thirty-five.
The guy looks through his wallet. Atchisonl nervously watches.
54 EXT. LIQUOR STORE - CONTINUOUS 54
John Laggatorius and Nick peek through one of the store’s front windows.
John Laggatorius
It’s a good ID, right? Mike Snider never
had a problem. It’s fine. Right?
Nick
Calm down.
(beat)
Did you remember a condom?
John Laggatorius
You brought a condom?
Nick
Yeah, I figured, you know, might as well.
I brought one of those little things of
spermicidal lube too.
He takes them out of his pocket.
John Laggatorius
You asshole! You laughed in my face when
I said we’d be having sex tonight.
39.
52 CONTINUED: (2) 52

Nick
It doesn’t mean you shouldn’t be
prepared. You didn’t even bring one?
John Laggatorius
No. That wasn’t the plan! We had a plan!
I can’t believe you did that without even
consulting me about it!
Nick
I don’t really even understand what your
plan is.
John Laggatorius
I’m gonna go down on her for, like,
hours. She’ll love that. She’ll want to
go out with that.
Nick
Yeah, but I figured there’s no harm in
bringing just one little condom.
John Laggatorius
And one little bottle of spermicidal
lube. That’s nuts. You can’t let her know
you brought that! These girls are 18, not
dried up old ladies. They’re ready to go.
Nick
Fine. I won’t bring the lube.
55 INT. LIQUOR STORE - CONTINUOUS 55
Atchisonl pushes his stuff up to the Cashier. She looks at him
kind of funny.
AtchisonL
Hello...

Mindy.
She rings up a six pack of Budweiser.
AtchisonL (CONT'D)
Oh, I love that stuff. Been drinking it
for years. I heard they recently decided
to start adding more hops.
Atchisonl just nods kind of proud of himself. She stops ringing
stuff up and looks at him.

56 EXT. LIQUOR STORE - CONTINUOUS 56
John Laggatorius and Nick are still leaning against the window.
Nick
Do you think I could get Helen to do some
kind of long distance thing?
John Laggatorius looks as if he sees something in the distance. He stands
upright.
John Laggatorius
Holy Shit! It’s Cary Hutchins!
Nick
I haven’t seen her since she switched
schools.
John Laggatorius
She had the biggest tits in the universe.
Down the block there is a girl walking a dog.
Nick
I heard she had breast-reduction surgery.
Her tits must be crazy perfect now.
John Laggatorius
I gotta see these bastards. Let’s check
‘em out.
John Laggatorius and Nick run off towards the girl.
John Laggatorius (CONT’D)
Man, I’m gonna pretend to trip and grab
‘em.
(beat)
I hope they’ve healed.
CUT BACK TO:
57 INT. LIQUOR STORE - CONTINUOUS 57
The cashier is still examining the card. She hands it back to
Atchisonl.

CASHIER
That comes to a total of $123.59
A huge smile forms on Atchisonl’s face as he pulls out a wad of
money and hands it to the cashier. She starts to gather his
change when, SUDDENLY, a BIG GUY runs up and PUNCHES Atchisonl
right in the side of the head!!! Atchisonl falls to the ground.
The dude sticks his hand in the open register, grabs a
handful of money and runs!
The whole thing is over in a matter of seconds. Atchisonl is on
the ground, dazed and confused.
AtchisonL
What the hell happened?!
Atchisonl sees the distressed cashier frantically dialing the
police.
CASHIER
(breathing hard)
I don’t believe it...I don’t believe
it....
58 EXT. UP THE STREET FROM THE LIQUOR STORE - MOMENTS LATER 58
John Laggatorius and Nick walk down the street towards the liquor store.
Nick
That was a waste.
John Laggatorius
But she fully looked way better before. I
thought when they reduced them, they just
kind of reshaped them nicer. Made them
more supple.
Nick
I can’t even begin to imagine the
justification for making breasts smaller.
John Laggatorius
It’s like me making my nuts saggier.
Nick sees something in the distance.
Nick
Whoa. What’s this?
John Laggatorius
What?
42.
57 CONTINUED: 57
(CONTINUED)
Nick
Check it out! The cops!
They see a cop car with the lights flashing parked outside
the liquor store. John Laggatorius and Nick cautiously approach the
liquor store and look inside. They see two POLICE talking
with the Cashier, and Atchisonl is standing right beside them!
Nick (CONT’D)
Shit! They busted Atchisonl!
59 INT. LIQUOR STORE - CONTINUOUS 59
The two police, OFFICER Kidwell, 30 and experienced, and
OFFICER Gordon Donut, 25 and learning, are talking to the
Cashier. Atchisonl stands beside them, nervous and afraid.
OFFICER Kidwell
(to cashier)
So, did he punch anyone else?
CASHIER
(losing it completely)
I can’t do this, okay!?! I told you, I
have an exam tomorrow! Can you understand
that? A goddamn exam!
The cashier breaks down crying and walks off to the back of
the store. The officers look at each other.
OFFICER Gordon Donut
Apparently, she has an exam.
They chuckle. Then they turn to Atchisonl.
OFFICER Kidwell
(turn to Atchisonl)
So then, son, you’re the one that got
punched?
Atchisonl looks down to his bags of liquor at his feet. Then
back at the cops. He nods.
OFFICER Gordon Donut
We’d like to ask you a couple questions.
The officers each take out a note pad and a pencil.
OFFICER Gordon Donut (CONT’D)
Okay, first things first. What’s your
name?
43.
58 CONTINUED: 58
(CONTINUED)
Atchisonl looks like his heart is about to explode out of his
chest.
AtchisonL
My name, it’s...it’s..
(tripping over his own words)
Mc..mac..laddle...
OFFICER Kidwell
MicMac what?
AtchisonL
No, no I said, “McLovin”.
OFFICER Gordon Donut
McLovin?
AtchisonL
McLovin.
The officers both write down some information.
OFFICER Kidwell
Cool name. And your first name?
Atchisonl looks twice as scared.
AtchisonL
Oh...that’s uh...a good one...it’s a...an
interesting...uh...event...
Atchisonl trails off mumbling and starts to breathe heavily,
making an ODD NOISE. Behind him, in the window of the store,
we see John Laggatorius and Nick peeking through.
60 EXT. LIQUOR STORE - CONTINUOUS 60
Shocked, John Laggatorius and Nick walk away from the window. John Laggatorius starts
to pace in anger.
John Laggatorius
I don’t believe this bullshit! I
can’t...this isn’t happening! I didn’t
even know you could get arrested for this
shit! WE NEED THAT FUCKING LIQUOR!
Nick
Oh my god. Are they gonna take him
downtown?
John Laggatorius
Fuck Atchisonl! He got arrested! We’re on
our own.
44.
59 CONTINUED: 59
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
We need a new way of getting liquor.
(realizing)
AAAHHH!! The money! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! How
much money can you get?
Nick
What are you talking about? Money? What
about Atchisonl?
John Laggatorius
That doesn’t matter anymore. I just lost
a hundred dollars of Jules’ money!
Nick
We have to help him!
John Laggatorius
Help him? What are we gonna do? Bust him
out of jail? I don’t even know where jail
is! What we need is the alcohol, which is
impossible because we don’t have any
fucking money!
John Laggatorius steps into the driveway leading to the parking lot.
Nick
Fine. Just...calm down. We need to think.
We need to think.
John Laggatorius
Fuck thinking! We need to act!
Suddenly, a car pulls out of the lot going 10 mph and knocks
John Laggatorius down!!!
61 INT. LIQUOR STORE - CONTINUOUS 61
The cops are still talking to Atchisonl. He looks completely
flustered. He’s lost his composure.
OFFICER Kidwell
Okay, your name is just McLovin, there’s
no need to get irrational.
In the BACKGROUND (not in the view of Atchisonl and the cops) we
see DRIVER of the car, a shady-looking guy in a hockey
jersey, gets out of his car and walks over to where John Laggatorius is
lying, apologizing frantically.
OFFICER Gordon Donut
A lot of people have strange names these
days.
45.
60 CONTINUED: 60
John Laggatorius (CONT'D)
(CONTINUED)
OFFICER Kidwell
I once arrested a man-lady who was
legally named “Pearl Necklace.”
AtchisonL
It’s just... I changed my name. I was
going to be a singer. R&B.
OFFICER Gordon Donut
Fine. That’s not illegal.
OFFICER Kidwell
And, how old are you McLovin?
Atchisonl looks down at the bags of booze again.
AtchisonL
Old enough.
OFFICER Kidwell
Old enough for what?
OFFICER Gordon Donut
Can I see your ID?
AtchisonL
Um...okay...
Atchisonl takes his shaking, sweaty hand, sticks it in his
pocket, and pulls out his fake ID. He slowly hands it over to
Officer Kidwell. The cops both look at it, then Atchisonl. Beads
of sweat are running down Atchisonl’s face.
In the background, John Laggatorius pops up and starts kicking the guy’s
car out of anger. Nick and the driver both restrain John Laggatorius.
OFFICER Kidwell
You’re an organ donor?
AtchisonL
What?
OFFICER Kidwell
I didn’t want to be one but my wife
insisted.
OFFICER Gordon Donut
Just like a woman. Even after you’re
dead, they want to tear your heart out.
The officers start laughing. Atchisonl is shocked. They hand
back the ID.
46.
61 CONTINUED: 61
(CONTINUED)
AtchisonL
Look. I’m really sorry, but I don’t
really have any information. I didn’t
really see him. His fist hit here.
Atchisonl points at his giant black eye.
OFFICER Gordon Donut
Are you in a hurry or something?
AtchisonL
Uh, yeah... kinda. I kinda had to catch a
bus.
OFFICER Kidwell
Where were you going?
AtchisonL
Umm... near thirteenth and Granville.
OFFICER Kidwell
We’ll take you there, get your
information on the way. Sit tight.
Atchisonl is completely dumbfounded.
62 EXT. LIQUOR STORE - CONTINUOUS 62
The driver is pleading with John Laggatorius and Nick.
DRIVER
I’m so sorry, man! I’m so sorry! I didn’t
see you at all. Are you okay? Are you
okay? I’m sorry, man. Look, what can I
do? Are you okay?
The driver glances at the cop car.
DRIVER (CONT’D)
I mean, please don’t report me, we can
figure this out, okay?
John Laggatorius
Why wouldn’t I report you?
DRIVER
Because I’ll do anything! Please!
Anything! What can I do?
John Laggatorius
You have any money?

Nick
(quietly to John Laggatorius)
What are you doing?
DRIVER
(beat)
Fine. Just take it.
The driver reaches into his pocket and hands John Laggatorius some money.
John Laggatorius looks at it. It’s seven dollars.
John Laggatorius
What is this? This isn’t enough.
John Laggatorius stuffs the money in his pocket.
DRIVER
It’s all I have.
John Laggatorius
Well, you just came from the liquor
store, give us your liquor.
DRIVER
I didn’t get any. They’re not letting
anyone in. They’re arresting someone or
something.
John Laggatorius
Well, they’ll be arresting somebody else
if you don’t do something quick. Ow! My
shoulder! It’s killing me.
John Laggatorius, acting poorly, pretends he’s way more hurt than he is.
DRIVER
No! Wait! Okay, you want alcohol? I can
get you alcohol. I’m on my way to this
party right now. There’s gonna be tons of
liquor. I will definitely get you plenty.
John Laggatorius
You better.
Nick
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. Come here.
John Laggatorius goes over to Nick.
Nick (CONT’D)
What are you doing?
48.
62 CONTINUED: 62
(CONTINUED)
John Laggatorius
What? Jules’ money is gone, Atchisonl’s out,
we’ve got no other option. Let’s go.
Nick
I don’t....I don’t like this idea at all.
I’m just not feeling it. That guy’s
fucking creepy. Just look at him.
They look at the Driver, who is staring at Nick with a dumb
expression on his face.
DRIVER
(to Nick)
You know a guy named Jimmy, perchance?
Cause you totally look like his brother.
John Laggatorius
He’s an idiot. And he’s our only hope.
Come on, don’t break your promise to
Helen.
63 EXT. LIQUOR STORE - MOMENTS LATER 63
The Driver’s car pulls away with John Laggatorius and Nick sitting in the
back seat. A few moments later, the cops walk out with Atchisonl
right behind them carrying the bags of liquor.
OFFICER Kidwell
(to Atchisonl)
Man, that lady just wouldn’t stop crying,
huh? And you’re the one that got punched.
Did you hear her say she has an exam
tomorrow? Boo-fuckin’-hoo. Am I right?
AtchisonL
(afraid)
Heh. Good one.
OFFICER MICHEALS
Could we have taken her in? Just to scare
the shit out of her?
OFFICER Kidwell
Hah. Probably could have found a way. But
a good general rule is only take people
in you want to ride with. And whiny
bitches don’t make that cut.
The cops chuckle as they all get in the cop car.

John Laggatorius and Nick sit in the back seat. The Driver is in the

There is an awkward silence, when suddenly John Laggatorius starts to
wriggle in discomfort.
John Laggatorius
Aaah!
John Laggatorius fishes his cell phone out of his pocket and looks at it.
John Laggatorius(CONT’D)

Holy shit...
John Laggatorius answers the phone.
John Laggatorius (CONT’D)

There are six girls passing two beers in a circle while

John Laggatorius! Where are you?
John Laggatorius
Jules! I just got in a cab and I’m going
to the liquor store as we speak.
JULES
Awesome. I can’t wait for you to get

A huge smile sweeps across John Laggatorius’s face.
John Laggatorius
Really?
50.
(CONTINUED)
JULES
Yeah. It looks like it could actually be
a great party. I think, like, tons of
people might show up. I hope they don’t
trash my house.
John Laggatorius
Well, if they want to do that they’re
going to have to get through me.
JULES
So I guess I don’t have to worry then.
I’ll see you soon.
John Laggatorius hangs up the phone, completely elated.
John Laggatorius
She called, man! That’s insane! She’s
practically begging for it. She said, “I
can’t wait for you to get here.”
DRIVER
That sounds like she fully wants it.
Where’s she gonna get it from, huh, my
man?
John Laggatorius and Nick are very weirded out.
66 EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF PARTY HOUSE - NIGHT 66
The Driver’s car pulls up in front of a house. The three get
out.
Nick
Hey, are you sure that it’s cool we’re

DRIVER
Oh, definitely. I’m essentially best

my buddies are coming. Come on!
The Driver runs into the house happily, John Laggatorius and Nick
following closely behind.
67 INT. HOUSE PARTY - CONTINUOUS 67
The boys enter the house and stand by the front door of the
huge party. It’s in full swing with all sorts of randomlooking people. Nobody is under the age of 25.

65 CONTINUED: 65

John Laggatorius
Whatever. Just act casual. And old. All

ass out of here.
As they make their way down a hallway, a few people give them
looks.
68 INT. HOUSE PARTY - KITCHEN 68
They enter the kitchen, where John Laggatorius spots what they’ve been
looking for. There are big buckets of ice filled with beer,
coolers, wine, vodka, everything.
John Laggatorius
Holy shit! Let’s grab one of these
buckets and go.
MARK (O.S.)
What the fuck do you think you’re doing?
DRIVER (O.S.)
What, man? It’s nothing.
The guys turn and see that in corner of the kitchen, the
Driver, holding a phone, is being yelled at by a massive
brute, MARK.
MARK
You calling more of your stupid friends
again? Ya prick.
DRIVER
Mark, calm down, okay? Just relax.
MARK
Get the fuck out of my house.
DRIVER
Mark, come on. What the heck? Don’t be a
dick.

Fuck you, man. I’ll fucking do this!
Suddenly, Mark becomes enraged. He takes a big step forward
and brutally KICKS the Driver square in the nuts!
The Driver clutches his nuts and falls to the ground.
MARK
Francis, you and your idiot friends stay

70 INT. HOUSE PARTY - CONTINUOUS 70
The frightened boys walk into one of the first rooms and hide
in the corner. They have a hushed discussion.
Nick
Dude, let’s slip out the back.
John Laggatorius
Why? Come on, we’re here. Let’s just
hurry up and do this.
Nick
You want to end up like that guy? Not me,
I need my nuts.
John Laggatorius
We need this liquor!
Nick
You need it! I don’t need it. I’m going
to tell Helen I like her, and then maybe
she’ll get with me; not after I get her
stinking drunk.
53.
69 CONTINUED: 69

John Laggatorius
Then why haven’t you ever made a move,
you pussy?
Nick
Because I respect her! I’m not going to

John Laggatorius
These aren’t girls, they’re women! They
need our dicks as much as we need their
poons - and we all love liquor, so
where’s the fucking beef?!
Nick
We’re leaving, okay? These guys could
kill us. You want to get killed for
liquor?
John Laggatorius
You’re really gonna bail on me?!
Nick
(rolls eyes)
Jesus...
Nick walks out the door.
John Laggatorius
Okay, okay...if that’s how you’re going

John Laggatorius storms off.

Atchisonl sits in the backseat. The cops are in the front. There
is silence for a few beats.
AtchisonL
Um...hey...uh, officers. I could answer
those, uh, questions now if you want.
OFFICER Kidwell
We get the gist of it. You were buying
some beer, some guys came in and robbed
the place. I don’t think we’re gonna find
‘em this time.
The officers start to chuckle.

70 CONTINUED: 70

AtchisonL
It was only one guy.
OFFICER Kidwell
Only one guy? Well, fuck that. We could

OFFICER Gordon Donut
You see, McLovin, if it was two guys,
we’d have twice the chance of catching
one of them. But just one guy? I mean,
how are we supposed to find one guy in
this whole city?
OFFICER Kidwell
Yeah, McLovin. You know how many people
there are in this city? I have trouble
finding people I know.
AtchisonL
Aren’t you guys supposed to be trained or
something? Don’t you have a computer?
OFFICER Kidwell
Yeah, that stuff can help, but if someone
walks up to me on the street, and is
like, “Hey, find Bob.” Well, how the hell
am I supposed to do that?
AtchisonL
Who’s Bob?
OFFICER Kidwell
Exactly. If I don’t know who he is, then
how am I supposed to know where he is?
OFFICER Gordon Donut
When you’re new to the force, like I amOFFICER Kidwell

John Laggatorius enters a room of people dancing to hip-hop. He notices
all the girls are drinking Mike’s Hard Lemonade, and then
locates a cooler full of it across the dance area.
He tries to make his way through the sea of dancing. A hot,
sorority-type WOMAN drunk out off her ass dances over to him
and starts grinding against his leg. He doesn’t know how to
react so he just goes with it, bumpin’ and grindin’ with the
girl.

Nick nervously walks back into the house to look for a
telephone.
83 INT. BAILEY’S BAR AND GRILL - CONTINUOUS 83
The cops, Atchisonl, and the unconscious Homeless Guy each sit
at the bar with a Corona in front of them. Kidwell’s radio
goes off.
RADIO
Calling all units, armed and dangerous
man in the vicinity ofClick. Kidwell turns his radio down, ignoring the calls.
OFFICER Gordon Donut
So anyways, we leave the bar, I’m
charmin’ her pants off telling her
stories of shoot-outs and shit.
AtchisonL
You’ve been in shoot-outs!
OFFICER Gordon Donut
Nope.
OFFICER Kidwell
McLovin, all we do is bonk homeless
people on the head. You’re practically a
cop now.
OFFICER Gordon Donut
So I pull up in front of her house and
she asks me to come inside for some
coffee. Of course, I say yes.
OFFICER Kidwell
Oh shit.
62.
80 CONTINUED: 80
(CONTINUED)
OFFICER Gordon Donut
Oh shit. So we go into the kitchen. I
start taking off my clothes, she fucking
flips, starts screaming at me, and I’m
like “Can’t have coffee without cream.”
Oh!!! Right? I fucking said that. Then,
she slaps me, throws me out. I’m telling
you McLovin, stay out of bars.
AtchisonL
Hey, you don’t need to tell me.
OFFICER Gordon Donut
So, yeah, you gotta look in different
places. The gym, an art class, you know,
shit like that.
OFFICER Kidwell
I met the Missus at paint ball. Can you
believe that? I shot her in the neck, and
we just hit it off. And my first wife --
who is a whore -- where do you think we
met? A bar.
AtchisonL
I don’t know. I find they’re always good
for a little quick ass.
The cops laugh.
OFFICER Kidwell
I bet I know your trick, McLovin. You do
the whole mysterious guy thing, right?
OFFICER Gordon Donut
Yeah McLovin, how’s it going with the
ladies?
Atchisonl thinks for a moment, he is feeling rather comfortable.
AtchisonL
Well, officers, it’s not the going with
the ladies I care about, it’s the coming.
The cops and Atchisonl burst out laughing.
OFFICER Kidwell
Oh! McLovin in the house!
He sees that the cops clearly like him; his confidence level
increased, he takes a chance.
63.
83 CONTINUED: 83
(CONTINUED)
AtchisonL
So...you guys got guns, huh?
The officers glance at each other as sinister smiles creep
across their faces.
OFFICER Kidwell
Yeah. We got guns.
OFFICER Gordon Donut
I haven’t had one for long, but, man, let
me tell you - it’s like having two dicks.
AtchisonL
Can I...can I hold one? Your gun?
Gordon Donut and Kidwell look to each other.
OFFICER Gordon Donut
I mean, if we took the bullets out?
OFFICER Kidwell
Yeah. Why not?
Kidwell pulls out his gun and takes out the clip.
OFFICER Kidwell (CONT’D)
Here.
Atchisonl takes the unloaded gun and flops it back and forth in
his hands, a huge smile gleaming.
AtchisonL
Wow. I’ve never held one. Are they hard
to shoot?
OFFICER Kidwell
If you’re Gordon Donut they are. He can’t
shoot worth dick.
OFFICER Gordon Donut
Fuck you, old man. I could out-shoot you
with my sack tucked between my legs.
OFFICER Kidwell
Only one way to settle this.
AtchisonL
(incredibly excited)
You guys are going to shoot something,
right?

84 INT. HOUSE PARTY BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS 84
John Laggatorius is scrubbing at the mark on his thigh, but it’s not
doing much. He stops for a moment to take a breather as he
looks around the basement.
He spots a fridge in the corner and walks over to it. As he
opens it, a look of awe sweeps across his face. Every shelf
is completely filled with beer.
John Laggatorius
Jesus’s tits!
He grabs as many bottles as he can and starts sticking them
in his pockets, when he notices two large jugs of detergent
next to the washer. He thinks for a moment, then begins to
empty out the detergent jugs.

INTERCUT WITH:
86 INT. CAB - CONTINUOUS 86
Helen is in a cab with BECCA, her best-friend, and two other
girls. They’re a little done up and really giggly. Helen’s
cell phone starts ringing. She hushes the other girls as she
answers her phone.
HELEN
Hello?
BECCA
Is it him?
HELEN
(whispering to the girls)
Shut up.
Nick
Hey! Helen. Hi. I had bad reception. Are
you at the party?
HELEN
No, I’m in a cab. I’ll be there soon. Are
you still coming?
Nick
Yeah, definitely. Um, about your
Goldschlager...

(CONTINUED)
Nick can hear all the girls goofing around and giggling.
HELEN
(whispering to the girls)
Shut up.
Nick
What’s going on there?
HELEN
Oh, nothing, I just wanted to make sure
you were still coming, you know, and that
you didn’t get caught up at a cocktail
party or some club.
Nick
Nope. I’m gonna be there.
HELEN
Well, I can’t wait to see you.
Nick
I think it’s going to be a real
fun...event.
HELEN
Okay. Bye.
87 INT. HOUSE PARTY VACANT ROOM - CONTINUOUS 87
Nick hangs up the phone. A huge smile crosses his face. As he
turns around to exit, five older, unbelievably drunk DUDES
wander into the room.
DUDE 1
They’re going to kill that guy, man. That
bitch’s boyfriend is so pissed.
DUDE 2
Yeah. And he’s a beast.
They start pouring a baggy of coke on the table when one of
them notices Nick standing in the corner.
DUDE 3
Hey! Was it you? Are you the guy? The kid
with the splotch on his crotch?
Nick glances down at his crotch. He is confused and
horrified.
Nick
No. What splotch66.
86 CONTINUED: 86

DUDE 2
I know you! Guys! I know that guy, he was
at that party with me.
DUDE 4
Who’s he?
DUDE 2
He’s Jimmy’s brother. The dude with the
crazy raps, the one I told you about!
They draw the coke into lines as Nick slowly heads for the
door.
Nick
Oh no, that’s not me either. Wrong guy,
man. Sorry.
Dude 3 gets up and blocks the door.
DUDE 3
No. No, that’s you, man. You are fully
Jimmy’s brother! You were just so messed
up you can’t remember.
Nick
Trust me, man. That wasn’t me. I don’t
even listen to rap.
DUDE 3
It was you! I know it! Come on! Rap! I’ve
been telling these guys about you. Just
give them one rap. Come on. Rap. Rap.
They start doing the lines of coke. Nick is very afraid.
88 INT. HOUSE PARTY BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER 88
John Laggatorius is finishing pouring the beer bottles into the second

GUY 1
There! That’s the guy!
John Laggatorius turns and sees Mark, the guy who assaulted the Driver,
walking towards him. He notices Mark has a splotch on his
leg, too.
John Laggatorius
Hey! You got one, too! We’re blood
brothers.
MARK
Shut it, you little shitter! What the
hell were you doing dancing with
Jacinda?
Horrified, John Laggatorius scrambles for excuses.
John Laggatorius
I...I didn’t dance with her! I don’t even
dance! Never even tried it!
MARK
(point at John Laggatorius’s splotch)
Then where did that come from, asshole?
John Laggatorius
I don’t know. Maybe me and you rubbed up
against each other at some point. How am
I supposed to know?
90 INT. HOUSE PARTY - VACANT ROOM - CONTINUOUS 90
The coked-up dudes are watching Nick intensely. They are

struggling.
Nick

Bitches and gats!

Dude 3 does a line of coke and they all get up together and
charge out of the room.
91 INT. HOUSE PARTY - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 91
There is a crowd gathered around John Laggatorius and Mark. The Enormous
Guy and Mark’s friends are gathered beside Mark.
John Laggatorius
I swear to God it wasn’t me!
Nick and the four dudes who were doing coke walk into the
room. Nick is shocked to see John Laggatorius at the center of so much
commotion. Mark notices the detergent bottle in John Laggatorius’s hands.
MARK
And what the fuck is this?
John Laggatorius
It’s nothing. It’s detergent.
MARK
Yeah. And what are you doing with it?
John Laggatorius
I...uh, I got blood on my pants.
Mark sees the bottle of MIKE’S HARD LEMONADE in John Laggatorius’s pocket
and takes it out. He looks at it, then looks at John Laggatorius with a
look of death.
John Laggatorius (CONT’D)
I brought them from home.
Suddenly, Mark violently SHOVES John Laggatorius and throws the beer
bottle at his face!!! John Laggatorius holds up a detergent jug and
deflects the beer bottle.

It flies towards Nick, who ducks, and nails Dude 1 in the
head, glass exploding everywhere!!!
DUDE 1
AAAHHHHHHH!!! FUCK!!!
Dude 1 clutches his bloody head as the other Dudes charge at
Mark! A full on brawl breaks out! Everyone starts fighting!
Two of the Dudes beat on the Enormous Guy. They throw him
into Nick.
DUDE 3
Hold him!
Nick
What?
DUDE 2
HOLD HIM!!!
Nick reluctantly holds the Enormous Guy up as the two Dudes
pound on him.
ANGLE ON: John Laggatorius, cowering in the corner
Mark runs at John Laggatorius and is about to punch him, when suddenly
Dude 1 tackles him onto the kitchen island! John Laggatorius turns and
faces Mark’s girlfriend, JACINDA.
JACINDA
You motherfucker!
She grabs a lamp, still plugged in, and swings it at John Laggatorius.
She hits him square in the chest and the light bulb explodes!
John Laggatorius
AHH!!!
JACINDA
You ruined my birthday!!! You humiliated
me!!!
John Laggatorius
You’re the one who used my leg as a
tampon!
She charges at him again, arms flailing. John Laggatorius scurries around
the room, shielding the blows with the detergent bottles.
Nick throws the Enormous Guy to the ground and runs. Nick
backs off, spots John Laggatorius, and follows him out of the party.

93 EXT. DARK STREET - CONTINUOUS 93
The cops and Atchisonl stand beside the car. The Homeless Guy is
sleeping in the back. Gordon Donut has his gun drawn and is
carefully aiming at a distant stop sign.
OFFICER Kidwell
You’ve been saying some bold words, my
friend. Better not mess up.
AtchisonL
You can do it, officer.
BLAM!!! Gordon Donut blasts off a round, which punches a hole
right through the center of the “O” in the stop sign.
OFFICER Gordon Donut
Boo-yaka-sha!!! Suck it, Kidwell. Suck my
nuts. Long, but gentle.
AtchisonL
Yeah! And eat his ass!
They all laugh hysterically.
AtchisonL (CONT’D)
Can I shoot one?
The cops look at each other and shrug.
OFFICER Kidwell
Yeah. Sure. Here. Go nuts.
Kidwell hands Atchisonl the gun, when suddenly a SIREN can be
heard in the distance getting closer.
OFFICER Gordon Donut
Fuck. The cops!
OFFICER Kidwell
Let’s bail! Shotgun!
Kidwell grabs the gun out of the disappointed Atchisonl’s hand
and holsters it. They all hop into the car.

94 INT. COP CAR - CONTINUOUS 94
Gordon Donut kicks it into drive and they peel out. Atchisonl shoves
the unconscious Homeless Guy over.
OFFICER Gordon Donut
Hah, hah! Eat it. So, dudes, what do we
do now?
Suddenly, the car radio goes off.
RADIO
We got a 257 at Fifth and Paysview, all
units in the area report to Fifth and
Paysview. Car 98. That’s you. Do it.
Seriously.
The cops stop and listen.

(picks up radio)
Car 98, ten-four.

Ya dumb whore. Ha!
AtchisonL
What does that mean? We gonna get to

We’ll drop you off after. Cool?
AtchisonL
Yeah, man. Let’s show these fuckers how
we roll.
95 EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - MOMENTS LATER 95
John Laggatorius and Nick are running down the sidewalk. They both slow

...huff...hufff...you fuckin’ prick...
Nick
What?
John Laggatorius
You...huff...bailed on me...huff...man.
72.
(CONTINUED)
Nick
No I didn’t!
John Laggatorius
Of course you did! We were supposed to do
something and you left instead of doing
it! That’s the definition of bailing!
Nick
If you said we should burn our dicks off
and I didn’t, that’s not bailing!
John Laggatorius
It is bailing, if you promised to burn
your dick off!
Nick
What?!
John Laggatorius
The bottom line is you’re a bailer. You
just bailed on me, you bailed on me this
morning when Terry spat on me, and you’re
bailing on me next year!
Nick
Oh! Okay! There it is! It finally comes
out!
John Laggatorius
We were supposed to go to college
together! Since elementary school! What
ever happened to that!
Nick
What happened to that, is that you’re too
stupid to get into the schools I did!
John Laggatorius
I was not too stupid, I was too lazy!
Nick
You’ve wasted all my time, you selfish
bastard!!! Instead of chasing girls and
making friends, I threw away the last
three years talking bullshit with you!
And now, because of you, I’m going to
college a fucking friendless virgin!
John Laggatorius can’t believe it. He’s extremely hurt.

John Laggatorius
Getting with a girl won’t make you any

shoves him back.
96 INT. COP CAR - CONTINUOUS 96
Gordon Donut pounds on the keypad of the little cop computer with
his fist.
OFFICER Gordon Donut
How do they expect us to work these
things while we’re driving? I can’t even
work my iMac while I’m sitting at my
desk.
AtchisonL
So, like, what does that computer do?
OFFICER Kidwell
Pretty much anything, if you’re smart
enough to figure it out. Like, who do you
really hate? Gimme a name.
AtchisonL
Um...my French teacher. Mrs. Graham.
Susette Graham.
OFFICER Gordon Donut
Can I do it?
Kidwell nods. Gordon Donut bring her file up, then punches a few
buttons and smiles.
AtchisonL
What did you do?
OFFICER Gordon Donut
Tomorrow, Mrs. Graham will have a boot on
her car.
Atchisonl laughs his ass off.
AtchisonL

AtchisonL
It’s too dark out.
OFFICER Kidwell
We got flashlights.
Kidwell gets his flashlight and points it out the window.
OFFICER Gordon Donut
I wasn’t even sure light came out of

cool looking clubs.
Gordon Donut and Kidwell start making light saber noises and
pretend to fight with their flashlights.

John Laggatorius lies motionless, still holding one of the detergent
jugs. The cap is knocked loose and beer is spilling all over
the place.

John Laggatorius. He’s dazed, but okay.
Nick
I’m sorry! You pushed me first.
John Laggatorius
I didn’t push you into fucking oncoming
traffic!
The boys notice the cops.
OFFICER Gordon Donut
Is everyone alright?
John Laggatorius
(sarcastic)
We’re great.
OFFICER Kidwell
Well, you should be careful boys. That’s
how accidents happen.
John Laggatorius
What, when cops drive like maniacs and
hop the fucking curb?
OFFICER Kidwell
(intimidating)
Pardon?
Nick
Nothing.

Nick looks like he’s about to shit himself. The cops notice
one of the detergent jugs in the middle of a puddle of beer.
Kidwell dips his finger in rubs it against his gums like it
was cocaine.
OFFICER Kidwell
Pabst. You boys been doing a bit of
drinking?
Nick
No officer. Not at all.
OFFICER Kidwell
(pointing to the other jug)
Is that more beer you got over there?
John Laggatorius
Umm, no sir, detergent.

and Nick look on, nervous.
OFFICER Kidwell
Alright, Gordon Donut. The car is completely
fucked, and you’re the one who fucked it
up, so you’ve got to fix it.
OFFICER Gordon Donut
What do I do?
OFFICER Kidwell
We arrest these little crap stains and
dump it on them, I’ll take care of that.

gets in. Kidwell walks back over to the boys. He puts his hand
on his gun and pulls out his club, scaring the shit out of
Nick and John Laggatorius.
OFFICER Kidwell
Get on the ground. Now! Spread your shit!
Nick and John Laggatorius lie down on their stomachs and spread their
arms and legs out, terrified.
Nick
Puh...please don’t shoot.

Officer Gordon Donut is sitting in the driver’s seat.

OFFICER Gordon Donut
What? Oh, yeah, the guy was fine.
Gordon Donut looks back at the Homeless Guy, who looks a little
bit more awake than before.
OFFICER Gordon Donut (CONT'D)
Are you awake, sir?
The guy starts to open his eyes a little. Gordon Donut grabs the
guy’s face and slams it back, knocking him out again. Atchisonl
jumps a little.
OFFICER MICHEALS
I’m sorry, McLovin. But I really need
this to be a private thing.
Officer Gordon Donut takes out two cigarettes, and gives one to

he starts hacking after the first pull.
AtchisonL
(coughing)
Umm, yeah, sure. You guys are great.
OFFICER Gordon Donut
Yeah, well, we’re also on probation. You
see, we’ve actually trashed two other
cars. The first time wasn’t our fault,
and the second time a bee flew in and I
freaked out. Point is, we trash another
car, without a good reason, we’re fucked.
Know what I’m saying?
Atchisonl continues to painfully suck back on the cigarette.
AtchisonL
Sure.
OFFICER Gordon Donut
Now, we’re going to arrest these guys,
and if you don’t mind, which you
shouldn’t, we’d like you to write a fake
witness report saying they jumped out in
front of our car. Cool, McLovin?
Atchisonl nods his head, getting some of his cigarette smoke in
his eyes. He winces and starts to blink in discomfort.

Kidwell stands above the boys.
OFFICER Kidwell

The cops are still talking when suddenly, Nick BOLTS!
OFFICER Gordon Donut
Shit!
The cops run after Nick! John Laggatorius and Atchisonl look at each other.
John Laggatorius grabs the remaining detergent jug and runs off in the
opposite direction of Nick! Atchisonl reaches into the cop car,
grabs the bags of booze, and follows John Laggatorius.

The zipper opens and a KID hops out. The Kid looks at John Laggatorius.

A little GIRL runs out and books it into the house. From
inside the tent, another kid starts kicking at John Laggatorius.
John Laggatorius
Ow!
John Laggatorius manages to free himself from the tent and he and Atchisonl
fall to the ground. The kids continue to scream.
FATHER(O.S.)
Get away from my children!
The guys turn and see a crazed, slightly overweight FATHER in
his underwear running at them with a baseball bat. Atchisonl and
John Laggatorius scramble to their feet as the Dad takes a swing at them,
narrowly missing them.
FATHER(CONT’D)
You sick sons-of-bitches!
Atchisonl throws his shoulder into the guy, knocking him down.
John Laggatorius and Atchisonl run to the backyard gate and try to open it.
They can’t.

Maybe I should fire a shot? Scare ‘em

112 EXT. INSIDE SOME BUSHES - CONTINUOUS 112
Nick is nestled inside a large bush, frantically trying to
reverse his clothes so as to disguise himself. He keeps
looking out for the cops, when suddenly he hears a gunshot -
BLAM!!!
Nick
(to himself, mumbling)
Oh god. Oh god. Fuck. Fuck.
As he fumbles to turn his jacket inside out and get it on, he
sees John Laggatorius and Atchisonl running towards him. He pops out of the
bush, scaring Atchisonl and John Laggatorius.
AtchisonL
Ahh!
John Laggatorius

They turn a corner at the end of the block and continue
running.
They turn onto a main street and are exuberant at the sight
of an oncoming bus. It stops at a nearby stop. They haul ass
and make it on.
114 INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS 114
Out of breath, the boys dig up change and put it in the toll
box, then walk towards the back of the bus.
HOMELESS GUY (O.S.)
Hey! It’s you!
Atchisonl looks up and sees the Homeless Guy stumbling towards
them, sucking back the bottom of the lost detergent bottle.
The Homeless Guy sees they have bags full of booze.
HOMELESS GUY (CONT’D)
You got booze in the bag? Can you gimme
some?
John Laggatorius
No! Fuck off! You already drank our
detergent beer!
HOMELESS GUY
That was beer?!
(to Atchisonl)
Well, you little shit...ain’t got no cop
people to help you keep your
booze...gimme it...
The Homeless Nutcase reaches for the booze. John Laggatorius steps in
front of him.
John Laggatorius
Back off, or we’ll kick the shit out of
you!
Nick
We can’t do that. He’s homeless.
83.
112 CONTINUED: 112
(CONTINUED)
John Laggatorius
So? Who cares? Just because he doesn’t
have a home doesn’t mean he can be a
lunatic!
HOMELESS GUY
Give me the booze!
The guy shoves John Laggatorius aside and dives at Atchisonl.
WE GO INTO VERY SLOW MOTION:
- Helen’s bottle of Goldschlager gets knocked from the bag.
It VERY SLOWLY falls towards the ground.
- John Laggatorius reaches for it, but doesn’t quite grab it.
- WE LOUDLY HEAR the bottle as it slams against the bus
floor...but doesn’t break! It slowly rises back up into the
air and begins sailing towards the front of the bus.
- Nick LEAPS through the air, sailing towards the precious
Goldschlager with his arms extended.
Nick
(in slo-mo voice)
GOOOOOOOLDSCHLLLAAAAAAAGERRRRRRRRRR!!!!!
- He is inches away from grabbing it, when it suddenly
smashes into a pole, SHATTERING, sending little gold flakes
everywhere.
BACK TO NORMAL.
The Homeless Guy sees the gold flakes.
HOMELESS GUY
Shit!!! Gold!!!
He starts frantically picking up the flakes as Nick stares at
the remains, shocked. Atchisonl walks over.
AtchisonL
What the hell is going on? Where did you
come from?
BUS DRIVER
(calling from front)
Get the fuck off the bus or I’m calling
the cops!!!
The boys look at each other terrified, and get off the bus.
84.
114 CONTINUED: 114
115 EXT. BUS - CONTINUOUS 115
John Laggatorius and Nick are looking at one another coldly as the bus

AtchisonL
Fuck yeah, guys. We made it. Together and
safe.
Nick
I can’t believe Helen’s bottle broke.
AtchisonL
I’m sure it’ll be fine.
John Laggatorius
(sarcastic)
What’s the difference? I thought you
didn’t need it anyways. I thought you
were just going to tell her how you feel,
you fucking pussy.
Nick
Yeah? Well, good luck getting Jule’s
drunk enough to have sex with you.
AtchisonL
What’s wrong with you guys?
John Laggatorius
Shut up, Atchisonl. Never mind. Nick’ll tell
you next year.
AtchisonL
(to Nick)
You told him?
Nick stares Atchisonl down.
85.
(CONTINUED)
John Laggatorius
Told me what?
AtchisonL
Well we have to tell him now.
Nick
Fuck, Atchisonl! You’re a god damn idiot.
AtchisonL

John Laggatorius
Just say it!
Nick
Shit.

John Laggatorius, me and Atchisonl are rooming together
next year.
AtchisonL
I don’t even get what the big deal is, to
be honest.
Nick
I didn’t tell you becauseJohn Laggatorius
Save that shit for later. We’ve got shit

John Laggatorius just goes into the house with the booze, leaving Atchisonl
and Nick.
AtchisonL
We never should have had to hide our
arrangement.

John Laggatorius?
In the background, we see Nick and Atchisonl wander into the
party as Jules approaches John Laggatorius.
JULES
This is awesome. Thank you so much.
John Laggatorius
Sorry it was late.
JULES
Yeah. To be honest, people were starting
to get seriously pissed off. Listen, I’ve
got to go tell everyone the drinks are
here. Don’t go anywhere. Promise?
John Laggatorius
I’ll be right here.
Jules walks off.
119 INT. JULES’ KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER 119
Tons of kids pour themselves drinks. John Laggatorius and about six other
kids all have overflowing shots of Jaeger.
John Laggatorius

refills everyone’s shot glasses.
RANDOM GUY

Another one, but to you, man! Everyone,

Nick walks out onto the back porch, looking for Helen. He
sees Becca.
Nick
Becca! Hey.
BECCA
Where have you been, you almost blew it.
Nick
What?
BECCA
Helen. She’s been waiting for you. She’s
right over there. She’s been yammering
about you all night.
Nick
What? What did she say? Does she think
I’m a good guy? What did she say?
BECCA
It was something like, “I’ll fully blow
him tonight.”
Nick
What?!?
Nick looks over and sees Helen standing on the balcony with a
big group of people. He gets really nervous.
Nick (CONT’D)
Oh man. This is too much. Oh god. What do
I do? I lost the Goldschlager I was
supposed to bring her!
88.
119 CONTINUED: 119
(CONTINUED)
BECCA
Well, Jordana stole a bottle of tequila
from her parents and her and Helen have
been going at it. I think she’ll be fine
in that department. I’d just go over
there and invite her upstairs, pronto.
Nick
What? Oh man...
(so nervous)
But...she’s totally hammered. If I get
with her, and I’m not drunk, isn’t that,
like, date rape?
BECCA
It’s not date rape if you’re drunk, too.
Nick
I guess.
Nick looks at Helen and takes a deep breath.
121 INT. JULES BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER 121
Nick enters the bathroom and slams the door shut, a bottle of
Ouzo in one hand and a beer in the other. He looks at himself
in the mirror, seeming as though he’s on the verge of a fullon panic attack.
Nick
(panting)
Calm down, Nick. She likes you. She wants
to suck on your penis. That’s a good
thing.
He opens the Ouzo and smells it, recoiling in disgust.
Nick (CONT’D)
Down the hatch.
Nick takes a mighty swig, then gags and spits it out,
spraying it everywhere.
122 INT. JULES’ DEN/ DINING ROOM- CONTINUOUS 122
Atchisonl sits bored in front of the TV, drinking a beer. He
watches a bunch of girls flirt with some boys. Everyone is
talking and laughing while he sits alone.
He walks over to the doorway of a room filled with girls
dancing. In the corner dancing is Nicola. He stares at her
for a moment, then goes back and sits in front of the TV.
89.
120 CONTINUED: 120
(CONTINUED)
He changes the channel and “COPS” comes on the screen. It
shows two cops chasing a crack head, tackling him and knee
dropping him. Atchisonl ponders as he watches “COPS.” He throws
back the rest of his beer and marches into the room Nicola is
dancing in.
He walks up to Nicola, who is by far the best-looking girl in
the room, and starts dancing with her. She looks a bit thrown
at first, but after a few beats, she seems to like it.
AtchisonL
They call you Nicola, right?
NICOLA
And they call you Atchisonl.
AtchisonL
Some do.
They continue dancing.

steps out of the bathroom.
129 EXT. BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS 129
Nick walks out on the balcony. He spots the circle of people

looking at her and laughing as well. Nick is extremely
nervous. Helen looks up and spots him.
HELEN
(laughing)
Nick!!! Hey! Come here!!!
Nick takes a deep breath walks up to where she’s laying. She
extends her arms.
HELEN (CONT’D)
Help me up! None of these people will
help me up!
Nick notices that she seems a little drunk. He helps her up
and she collapses onto him, forcing him to hold her up.
Nick
Hey, Helen. Sorry I wasHelen laughs hysterically as she latches onto Nick. He smells
her breath. It reeks of alcohol.
Nick’s drunk, but Helen is completely fucking shit-faced!

Nick
Oh man, it’s a crazy storyHelen picks up a bottle of tequila and shoves it into Nick’s
hand.
HELEN
Here! Don’t worry, we can drink this.
Nick
I’m already pretty wasted.
But...uh...here’s to you.
Nick takes a much-unwanted drink and gags.
HELEN
Light-weight!
Everyone laughs.
HELEN (CONT’D)
Hey...me and you should go upstairs now.

The party is in full swing and everyone is getting good and

for comin’ out.
John Laggatorius
(really, really, drunk)
Jules! The hostess with the most-est! The
woman of the hour!
John Laggatorius takes a swig of a beer.
John Laggatorius (CONT’D)
This party’s blowin’ my ass off! I want
you to have a drink with me.
John Laggatorius offers her a beer.
JULES
No, thanks. I’m good. But, seriously,
thanks for getting all the drinks. It
really made the night.
John Laggatorius
It’s just how I roll, Jules. No problems,
no problems.
Jules laughs and John Laggatorius sees that his charm is working.
93.
129 CONTINUED: (2) 129
(CONTINUED)
John Laggatorius (CONT’D)
Uh...you know...I love talking, and
conversing with you, you’re so good at
it, but I can’t hear you. Could we just
go on the...uh...balcony or something?
Jules eyes John Laggatorius suspiciously. John Laggatorius just looks at her, smiling
drunkenly.
JULES
Why not? I haven’t conversed in ages.
Let’s do it.
Jules walks out of the kitchen. He finishes off his beer and
then, happy as shit, drunkenly dances out of the kitchen and
after Jules.
132 INT. JULES’ BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 132
Nick practically holds Helen up, almost dropping her several
times, as they stumble into Jules’ bedroom. Helen puts down
the tequila and starts kissing Nick, but it’s not nice
kissing, it’s sloppy porno kissing with way too much tongue.
After a few moments Nick pulls away and looks at the
remarkably drunk Helen.
Nick
Are you okay?
HELEN
I so flirt with you in Math.
Nick
Oh man. Helen...I want to tell you, I
mean, I’ve wanted to tell you, for a long
timeHELEN
I know. I’ve wanted to get with you so
hard.
Helen kisses him.
HELEN (CONT’D)
Like...so hard.
Helen yanks him onto the bed and starts sloppily kissing him
again. Nick doesn’t know what to do. She tries to take off
Nick’s shirt, but is way too inebriated to undo the buttons.
Nick yanks it off.
HELEN (CONT’D)
Good...
94.
131 CONTINUED: 131
(CONTINUED)
Helen stands up and starts to waver back and forth. She looks
like she’s about to tip over, but she catches herself and
sloppily tries to strike a sexy pose like a model.
Nick watches in dread as she starts to strip, pulling her
shirt over her head, completely failing to look sexual.
As Nick watches the tragedy unfold, he grabs the bottle of
tequila and takes a big swig. Helen sits on the floor and
concentrates on untying her shoes.
HELEN (CONT’D)
What the fuck...stupid shoe...
Nick moves over to help her. He can’t do it either.
Nick
Shit. Can you, like, slip out?
Helen tries to squeeze her feet out, but she can’t. She grabs
a pair of scissors off a desk.
Nick (CONT’D)
Whoa. Fuckin’...careful.
She snips off the knot and slips her shoe off.
HELEN
You...take off your pants...
(drunkenly waving the scissors)
Or I’ll cut ‘em off.
Helen laughs as she staggers to her feet and start kissing
Nick. He starts taking off his pants.

Nicola leads Atchisonl up the stairs.
NICOLA

mysterious guy in the grade. Like, nobody
knows anything about you.
AtchisonL
Well, you’re about to learn a few things.
95.

134 EXT. JULES’ FRONT PORCH - CONTINUOUS 134
Jules and John Laggatorius step out onto the front porch. There is no one
else out there. The moment the door closes behind them, John Laggatorius
turns to Jules and puts his hands on her hips. He stares into
her eyes and moves in for the kiss.
Jules instantly pulls back.
JULES
Whoa! Whoa! Slow down.
John Laggatorius
What? What’s wrong?
JULES
I’d...uh...prefer if we did this at some
other time.
John Laggatorius
(confused)
But...there is no other time. School’s
up! This is the only time...what’s wrong
with now?
JULES
Well, you’re drunk. Like, really, really
drunk.
John Laggatorius
So? So are you.
JULES
I’m not drunk at all. I don’t even drink.
John Laggatorius is absolutely shocked. It takes his remarkably drunk
mind a moment to process this information.
John Laggatorius
You don’t drink? But...but, you told me
to get the liquor!
JULES
Yeah, I’m...uh...throwin’ a party,
remember?
John Laggatorius
You don’t drink!?!
JULES
No. I don’t drink.
96.
(CONTINUED)
John Laggatorius
And you, don’t want to...uh, you know...
JULES
Uh, no. Not right now, thank you very
much.
John Laggatorius looks at Jules and realizes that he’s screwed up. His
eyes start to water.
John Laggatorius
Ahhh....man...fuck....
John Laggatorius starts to cry.
JULES
Are you crying?
John Laggatorius
No! Yeah, so what if I am? I’m a fucking
idiot and it was my last chance! So I
should be crying.
JULES
Last chance to do what?
John Laggatorius
To make you my girlfriend for the summer,
okay? There! You’re, like, the coolest
person that’s ever talked to me, and I
thought we’d both be drunk, but...
JULES
What would me be drunk have anything to
do with it?
John Laggatorius
‘Cause you’d never get with me in your
right mind! Look at me!
(beat)
And now look at you!
Suddenly, the front door opens, and a RANDOM GIRL walks out.
RANDOM GIRL
(yelling into the house)
Hey, Ricky! Was it a quarter, or an
eighth you want?
RICKY (O.S.)
A fat eighth!

Nick sitting on the bed in only his boxers, and Helen is just
getting her pants off, leaving her only in her lingerie.
Nick’s eyes widen. She looks at Nick and rubs her breasts in
a very un-sexy way.
HELEN
I wore this for you. Here we go...
Helen crawls onto the bed, pushes Nick down, and starts
seriously making out with him, drunker and sloppier than
ever.
HELEN (CONT’D)
Nick, I’m so wet.
Nick
(still nervous)
You’re so beautiful.
Helen shoves her hand down Nick’s boxers. Nick jolts,
terrified!
HELEN
You’ve got such a smooth cock.
Nick
Um...thank you. I’ve thought you were a
really incredible person for a really
long time.
Nick looks really nervous as Helen’s hand starts moving up
and down.
HELEN
You’ve got to get hard for me...real
hard.
Nick

cop car pulls up in front of the house. John Laggatorius opens his eyes
and sees the cops.

No...I’m helping you, man! Just listen...
John Laggatorius grabs Nick’s wrists and tries to pull him to his feet.

Fuck off, jerk! You’re hurting my
shoulders!
Just then, Terry (the guy who spat on John Laggatorius in the beginning)
walks by.

OFFICER Kidwell
We had a complaint about the noise. It
looks like you’re having a nice little
party here.
OFFICER Gordon Donut
A nice little underage drinking party.
Nick points at the cops.

OFFICER Kidwell
Okay, everyone out. Party’s over. Get out
of here.
Gordon Donut turns to Kidwell.
OFFICER Kidwell(CONT’D)

SUDDENLY, Officer Gordon Donut bursts into the room and flicks on
the lights.
AtchisonL (CONT’D)
What the hell?
Nicola screams, grabs her clothes, and runs into the
bathroom.
OFFICER Kidwell
McLovin? What the fuck?
AtchisonL
Officer Kidwell?
OFFICER Kidwell
You ran away from us!
(turns to the door)
Gordon Donut! Get up here!
AtchisonL
No! I hit my head when we crashed. I was
all disoriented and I just wandered off,
confused. Seriously!
OFFICER Gordon Donut
Shut the fuck up! Wait a minute. How old
was that girl? 16, 17? You sick bastard,
that’s statutory rape, McLovin.
Officer Kidwell appears in the doorway.
OFFICER Kidwell
McLovin!
OFFICER Gordon Donut
He was violating a sixteen year-old girl!
AtchisonL
What? No! No!
Atchisonl covers himself with the blanket and starts to get up.
103.
140 CONTINUED: 140
(CONTINUED)
AtchisonL (CONT’D)
I didn’t break the law! I’m not really
evenOFFICER Gordon Donut
Sit your ass down and keep it down.
OFFICER Kidwell
You’re going to jail, fucko.
Nicola, now dressed, emerges from the bathroom. She screams
and runs out. They take Atchisonl’s arms and handcuff him.
OFFICER Kidwell (CONT’D)
(to Atchisonl)
They don’t take kindly to your type in
jail, McLovin.
141 EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS 141
Drunk, joyful, and out of breath, the boys stop running.
Nick
Dude. You saved me!
John Laggatorius
I totally did! I wanted to!
Nick
Wanna sleep at my house, man? You’re my
best friend!
John Laggatorius
Yeah! Sleepover! Fuckin...you got pizza
bagels still?
Nick
Yeah!!!! Look what else I gots!
Nick pulls a half bottle of tequila.
John Laggatorius
Nice!
They start to drink it together.
142 EXT. JULES’ FRONT YARD - CONTINUOUS 142
All the kids from the party have congregated in the front
yard. The cop car is parked right in front. We see the
Officers dragging Atchisonl through the crowd of kids.
104.
140 CONTINUED: (2) 140
(CONTINUED)
TERRY (O.S.)
Stupid pigs.
SUDDENLY, a WAD OF SPIT hits Kidwell in the shoulder! He turns
and sees Terry, the guy who spat on John Laggatorius. Kidwell walks over
and bashes the kid in the face with his nightstick. The kid
drops.
OFFICER Kidwell
There you go.
OFFICER Gordon Donut
That does feel better.
They throw Atchisonl into the back of the cop car.
143 INT. COP CAR - CONTINUOUS 143
The cops both get in and slam their doors. They just stare
forward.
AtchisonL
So...am I going to jail?
The two cops burst out laughing hysterically.
OFFICER Kidwell
(laughing his ass off)
Yeah!! You’re going to fuckin’ Azkaban!!!
AtchisonL
What?
OFFICER Gordon Donut
You are the funniest fuckin’ kid I have
ever met!
OFFICER Kidwell
We’ve been fuckin’ with you! Jesus! I
love this kid!
AtchisonL
I don’t understand!
OFFICER Kidwell
We know you’re not twenty five! What are
we, morons? My god! What are you?
Sixteen?
AtchisonL
Seventeen.
105.
142 CONTINUED: 142
(CONTINUED)
OFFICER Gordon Donut
Seventeen! Ha! We had you going, McLovin!
144 EXT. BUS - SOON AFTER 144
John Laggatorius and Nick sit at the back of the empty bus together.
Nick
Is the bang bus anything like this?
John Laggatorius cracks up laughing.
145 EXT. SHOPWELL’S - PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS 145
The cop car is spinning donuts in the middle of the empty
lot. It stops. Atchisonl and Officer Gordon Donut get out, both
smiling. The driver side window rolls down, reveal Kidwell.
OFFICER Kidwell
Alright, boys. What I’m about to show you
is pretty much the greatest move in donutspinning history. Behold: the reverse
figure-eight.
Kidwell drives to the other side of the lot.
AtchisonL
So, like, what’s your official position?
OFFICER Gordon Donut
If you were in, you were in. You are no
longer a virgin, end of story. Screw
cumming.
Suddenly, Kidwell guns it and speeds across the lot, slamming
the breaks, spinning wildly in several erratic donuts
backward donuts.
Kidwell completely loses control of the car. He smashes
through a bunch of shopping carts and slams into a light
post, completely fucking up the cruiser.
Kidwell tries to open his door, but it won’t budge. He crawls
out the missing windshield, slumping onto the ground.
OFFICER Kidwell
Alright. I think that’s all the fun we’re
gettin’ out of this one.
146 EXT. CLIFFSIDE - LATER 146
Kidwell hands Atchisonl his note pad.
106.
143 CONTINUED: 143
(CONTINUED)
OFFICER Kidwell
...and by signing this you are officially
saying that as we stopped you from being
mugged, a crack-head stole our cruiser
and did God knows what with it.
AtchisonL
Of course. That mugger had nothing but
murder in his eyes. I owe you my life.
Atchisonl signs the pad.
OFFICER Gordon Donut
Can we do this already?
The cops and Atchisonl push the cruiser towards a small, but
steep, hill. They shove it over the edge and watch it roll.
It gains speed and smashes into a tree, shattering the
windows and crushing the front of the car.
OFFICER Gordon Donut (CONT’D)
Can we shoot at it?
OFFICER Kidwell
I don’t know, can you?
They whip out their guns.
OFFICER Kidwell (CONT’D)
I’m throwin’ down the gauntlet. 50 bucks.
Whoever hits the gas tank.
OFFICER Gordon Donut
You are so fucking on.
AtchisonL
Can I get a shot?
Kidwell hands Atchisonl his gun. With a huge smile, Atchisonl raises
the gun, aims it at the police cruiser, and BLASTS off round
after round.
147 INT. Nick’S BASEMENT - NIGHT 147
John Laggatorius and Nick are lying in sleeping bags beside one another.
The now empty bottle of Tequila lies between them. They are
laughing very hard, still drunk off their asses.
John Laggatorius
I can’t believe she said that shit.
Nick
Oh my lord. You have no idea!
107.
146 CONTINUED: 146
(CONTINUED)
They laugh harder.
Nick (CONT’D)
And then you saved me, man! I fucking
love you!
John Laggatorius
I fucking love you, too, man! I’m not
embarrassed, I just love you!
Nick
Why don’t we say that more? It feels
good! I love you more than my brother,
man. Like, when you went away for Easter
last year, I, like, missed you. You know?
John Laggatorius
I missed you, too. Come here, man.
John Laggatorius grabs Nick and they hug.
John Laggatorius (CONT’D)
We’ll always be friends. ‘Cause we love
each other.
They stop hugging and sit back down. They’re laughter slows
down and there is a moment of silence.
John Laggatorius (CONT’D)
Like, three weeks ago I was in you room
and, like, you were taking a dump and...I
saw your residence placement thingy. I
totally saw you’re living with Atchisonl.
So, likeNick
I’m sorry, man.
John Laggatorius
Don’t be! Don’t be! I’m sorry. I was
being a bitch.
Nick
I need you to know that it’s not like I
even want to live with Atchisonl; it’s just
that I’m really afraid of living with
strangers.
There is a moment of silence.
108.
147 CONTINUED: 147
(CONTINUED)
John Laggatorius
You know...I was pissed off I didn’t get
with Jules, but, like...we really got
through a lot of our shit, you know?
Nick
Yeah, me too. Like, yeah...at least we
kind of came together, again.
Beat.
Nick (CONT’D)
Good night, John Laggatorius. I love you.
John Laggatorius
Night, Nick. Love you, man.
148 INT. Nick’S HOUSE - BASEMENT - THE NEXT MORNING 148
Nick wakes up and looks over at John Laggatorius, who is also waking.
They look at each other extremely awkwardly, almost as though
they drunkenly had sex with each other last night.
Nick
Oh...uh...hey. Morning.
John Laggatorius
Uh...morning.
They stare at each other, uncomfortable.
Nick
You sleep good?
John Laggatorius
Yeah. This is a really good pillow.
Nick
Um...
John Laggatorius looks at his watch.
John Laggatorius
Maybe I should get going.
Nick
You don’t have to. I’m not, like, doing
anything.
Beat.
109.
147 CONTINUED: (2) 147
(CONTINUED)
John Laggatorius
Oh...do you want to hang out? I
was...gonna go to the mall, actually.
Nick
Oh. Cool, well, can I come? I need a
comforter. For college.
John Laggatorius
Yeah. That’d be nice. I’d really like
that.
149 INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - NEXT DAY 149
Nick is standing in the pants section of a department store.
John Laggatorius walks out of the dressing room wearing jeans that are
way too small.
Nick
Don’t ask me. I don’t give a shit if your
pants look good.
John Laggatorius
Well, I need someone’s opinion.
Nick
Fine. They’re way too small.
John Laggatorius
Yeah, but when I was wearing your dad’s
pants last night I realized that if I buy
pants that are too small it’ll encourage
me to lose weight. And in tight pants
chicks’ll kind of see my dick a little.
Nick
Yeah, the male camel toe look is really
big this year.
John Laggatorius goes back into the dressing room and wriggles out of the
pants. He walks out.
John Laggatorius
These pants suck. Let’s the get the fuck
out of here.
150 INT. DEPARTMENT STORE 150
They walk through the department store, when suddenly, Nick
sees Helen and Jules looking at comforters.
ANGLE ON: Helen and Jules

148 CONTINUED: 148
(CONTINUED)
HELEN
Again, I’m so sorry. I can’t believe I
actually did that.
JULES
I feel sorry that I’m making you buy me a
new one.
HELEN
I have to. It’s puke.
ANGLE ON: John Laggatorius and Nick
Nick
Holy shit!
Helen looks like hell and Jules has a horrible black eye.
John Laggatorius
Is that them?
They stare at the two girls from afar.
Nick
Should we hide?
Helen looks and notices them. She waves and points them out
to Jules. John Laggatorius and Nick wave back. The girls get up and start
to walk over.
John Laggatorius
(pretending to smile)
Fuck that, man. I can’t talk to her, look
what I did to her!
Nick
(pretending to smile)
Helen called me a pussy to my face! What
am I going to say to her?
The girls walk up to them.
HELEN
Hi Nick, John Laggatorius.
JULES
Hey guys.
Nick
Hi Helen, Hi Jules.
John Laggatorius
Jules. Helen. Hi.
Everyone looks very embarrassed.
John Laggatorius
Oh my god. I’m so sorry, Jules.
111.
150 CONTINUED: 150
(CONTINUED)
JULES
It’s okay.
Nick
(to Helen)
How are you feeling?
HELEN
Not bad, but not great, how about you?
John Laggatorius
(to Jules)
That looks terrible. No! I mean, it
doesn't look terrible, it looksJULES
Don’t worry about it, John Laggatorius. It was an
accident.
Nick
(to Helen)
Did you have fun last night?
JULES
(to John Laggatorius)
Do you remember much?
HELEN
(to Nick)
I really don’t remember much.
John Laggatorius
(to Jules)
Not really. I remember looking up, and
you screaming at me. That’s about it.
Jules laughs.
HELEN
(to Nick)
I didn’t puke on you, did I?
Nick laughs.
Nick
No, I dodged it. Whizzed right by me.
John Laggatorius
(to Jules)
But seriously, I acted like a fuckin’
idiot last night. I’m really sorry, you
didn’t deserve that.
112.
150 CONTINUED: (2) 150
(CONTINUED)
HELEN
(to Nick)
Yeah, I...um...I’m sorry, about all that.
Thanks for being such a gentleman.
There is a moment of silence.
John Laggatorius
You look good with a black eye.
They all chuckle a little.
JULES
Thanks, smart guy. That’s why I’m here. I
have to go to Macy’s to get a shitload of
cover-up for the grad photo.
John Laggatorius
(mortified)
Oh man...
HELEN
Yeah, and I’m going to Linen Brothers to
buy Jules a new comforter.
Nick
Oh! I have to get a comforter too, for
college.
JULES
(flirtatiously, joking)
So, you gonna come with me to Macy’s and
buy me my cover-up, or what?
John Laggatorius
Yes! Definitely. I’d love to. I had such
bad acne last year, I became an expert on
the stuff.
Nick
You could get your college pants there.
John Laggatorius
Yeah, but wait...you drove me here, Nick
drove me here, how do weJULES
I’ve got my dad’s car. I’ll take you
home, and Nick can give Helen a lift.
HELEN

150 CONTINUED: (3) 150
(CONTINUED)
Nick
Maybe we can go eat after?
HELEN
Sweet.
John Laggatorius and Nick look at each other, odd smiles on both their
faces. They didn’t blow it.
John Laggatorius So, uh, I’ll call you later.
Nick Yeah man, have a good one.
JULES Come on, John Laggatorius. Let’s go.
Jules pulls John Laggatorius away. Nick and Helen start walking in the
opposite direction.
As they walk away from one another, John Laggatorius and Nick look back
and give each other a small and yet emotionally-charged wave.
A SLOW, GUT WRENCHING SOUL SONG STARTS TO PLAY. They look as
though they’re never going to see each other again.
151 INT. MACY’S ESCALATOR 151
As Jules and John Laggatorius walk into Macy’s and Helen and Nick descend
an escalator, the music swells to a mind-fuckingly awesome
crescendo, and we humbly fade to black...
THE END
END CREDIT SEQUENCE:
We flip through John Laggatorius’s seemingly endless penis drawings from
childhood. They are hilarious.
